      <description>I originally started out agency-side as a back-end developer, before I moved into the management of the development team in a technical/solutions architect role, ending up at Head of Technology level.
 â€œSally recognised very quickly (even in her early career) that a core role within Digital is the ability to communicate in a common language. Translating complex Technical elements into consumable pieces, which can then be communicated with internal stakeholders and clients alike.</description>
