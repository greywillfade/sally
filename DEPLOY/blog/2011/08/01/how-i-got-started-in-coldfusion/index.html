        <div class="blog__contentholder">
            <p>A while ago Steve Bryant came up with the excellent idea of August 1st being designated <a href="http://www.bryantwebconsulting.com/blog/index.cfm/2011/7/20/August-1-2011-is-How-I-Started-ColdFusion-Day" target="_blank">How I Got Started In ColdFusion Day</a>, for which ColdFusion users tell their origin story. As a big fan of encouraging others to take up coding, I thought I&#8217;d bring my story to the table. Let&#8217;s start right back at the beginning&#8230;</p>

<p>We had computers in the house since I was young, and I&#8217;ve never felt any kind of fear or hesitation about jumping in and messing around using trial and error. I got to grips with DOS pretty fast, as was necessary in those days to launch games, and I remember some happy times using BBC computers at my primary school. The same school also had a physical &#8216;turtle&#8217; device that you could put things on, program, and it would travel through the school corridors to its destination, and this concept fascinated me.</p>

<p>Moving on, both technology and my usage of computers were changing. In secondary school the social elements started appealing more and more, and I would head home and use messengers to chat to my friends as well as exploring the new world of online communities. I&#8217;d also spend far too much time creating terrible graphics, feeling like I was a great computer artist until I looked back at them the next day (I still do this sometimes). In school that pesky turtle came up again &#8211; this time <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">in virtual form</a>, I was taught about Visual Basic for Applications, and I loved finding out about easter eggs such as the <a href="http://www.eggheaven.com/eggs/software/137-excel" target="_blank&quot;">flight simulator in Excel 97</a>. Looking back, I really appreciate the exposure that I was given to programming, especially considering that I was at a girls school. A lot of this was down to a fantastic IT teacher, who sadly left, causing the program to go incredibly downhill at A-level stage, where a lot of people lost their passion due to the replacement teacher&#8217;s textbook teaching approach.</p>

<p>I was probably around 14 when I started getting interested in creating websites. I went through a phase of creating awful looking things that were hosted using a variety of free services, and were initially built using products like FrontPage, or even Word. I know. I don&#8217;t even want to think what the code would have looked like. It was only after getting more involved with online communities and reading blogs that I started to understand that you had so much more control over the output if you created it by hand. I bought a huge book about HTML and CSS which I have to this day, and I started using View Source to work out how things had been done. I never ripped off anyone&#8217;s site, but I learnt an awful lot from grabbing the entire source for sites and adapting it to understand how things worked.</p>

<p>At this point everything was static. I had a blog, and that involved editing the homepage by hand, with archives being a copy/paste job into new files. It was all very tedious. On going to university that all changed. I&#8217;d known for a while that I wanted to do a computing course, and the course I ended up on taught me C, Java, Perl, PHP, Javascript, Actionscript, and&#8230; er&#8230; Lingo. We worked with Oracle and Access, and started making little basic CRUD applications. This was better &#8211; it does stuff!</p>

<p>Doing a sandwich course, my third year was a year in industry. There was only one place that I wanted to work for (they&#8217;d done the Lego Star Wars site &#8211; they must be awesome!), which was Lightmaker. I went for my interview and luckily got the job. I was told at the time that I should look into ColdFusion, as that would be one of the things I&#8217;d be working with. Within a couple of weeks I had been completely thrown in at the deep end &#8211; doing some major updates to an existing site for a big client, pretty much on my own. I will always be grateful to Julian Wheaton and Chris Williams, who both gave me a lot of time and patience, and taught me a lot.</p>

<p>Over the next few years I was a bit of an all-rounder &#8211; I mainly worked with ColdFusion or ASP, though I did a fair bit of Actionscript work too. At the time we were doing a lot of heavy, immersive Flash work, and ColdFusion was the natural pairing for a back-end technology. In general it made things so quick and easy to get done, and it was a great way to improve my general programming knowledge without getting bogged down with an unwieldy language or difficult syntax. From my humble student beginnings I started rising up the ranks, working on some huge client accounts and sites/brands that I genuinely loved, and even winning some big awards for some of them. The wonderful CF community played a big part in my development, as there are so many great snippets of code and bits of advice out there to learn from.</p>

<p>My role is a bit different now, and I spend most of my time talking to people about technology rather than getting my hands dirty. That&#8217;s not to say I turned my back on development &#8211; I have an R&amp;D element to my role, and I do a fair amount of coding outside of my day job. I like to think that I&#8217;ve simply evolved, and have been able to bring in other things that I enjoy, such as meeting people and finding solutions for their problems. I am very glad that I got started with ColdFusion, as without it I never would have got to where I am today.</p>
