      <description>‚ÄúWhat should I learn? Technology moves so fast! There‚Äôs so many options! How will I ever get through everything?‚Äù
In the coaching calls I‚Äôve been doing recently it‚Äôs been interesting to see some themes come up multiple times. One of those topics is people who‚Äôre struggling with feeling like there‚Äôs too much they need to learn or improve, and not knowing where to start. A few examples:
 Someone who has imposter syndrome, another who‚Äôs low on confidence and feeling they‚Äôre not valued.</description>

      <description>As you may have seen from a few mentions, I&#39;m soon going to be starting a new role. I‚Äôm very happy and excited to say that from October I‚Äôll be working as Head of Engineering at Farewill! üéâ
2020 continues to be a year of shifting plans, and adapting when needed or when opportunities arise. Despite working with some absolutely fantastic people and really believing in the mission at Monzo, when the option came up to be able to take voluntary redundancy, after a lot of thought I decided that leaving was the best path forward for me.</description>

      <description>Throughout September I‚Äôm going to be holding some free coaching sessions aimed at supporting folks from groups that are under-represented in the tech industry. Here‚Äôs a bit more about what that looks like and how it‚Äôll work.
üì£ Update: I&amp;rsquo;ve closed the form for now as I&amp;rsquo;ve had quite a bit of interest and want to get these folks booked in first. If possible I&amp;rsquo;ll re-open afterwards for a few more.</description>

      <description>When you think about ‚Äúscaling‚Äù in the context of engineering, does your mind jump to thinking about systems, or about growing your organisation? Or maybe both! These are topics that have had a lot written about them, but what I‚Äôd like to talk about in this post is from the perspective of you as an individual: how to scale yourself as a manager.
Everyone‚Äôs situation will vary in different degrees from others, but let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve started out on your management journey a little while ago.</description>

      <description>In this post I talk about flipping around a common management tactic ‚Äì the PIP ‚Äì to help people move through periods where they‚Äôre feeling unhappy at work
PIPs, or Performance Improvement Plans, are a topic that come up frequently when talking about managing people. Some people swear by them, others less so.
In a nutshell, the idea is that if an employee&amp;rsquo;s underperforming, they work with their manager to agree a plan for improvement over a set timescale.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve recently had conversations with some engineers who want to know more about what my day-to-day looks like, and what my path has been to get here. I thought I‚Äôd write a post in case it‚Äôs useful to others.
If you want to get a good general understanding of what different roles entail at different levels (outside of my individual journey, which isn‚Äôt necessarily typical!) the best book I‚Äôve read is the classic ‚ÄòThe Manager‚Äôs Path‚Äô, by Camille Fournier.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôre collectively living through a very strange time at the moment. Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to answer the question ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù honestly, because you don&#39;t actually know.
To help break this down, I‚Äôve put together a series of prompts that you may find useful, whether for asking yourself as an individual or used in a different capacity, like in 1:1s with reports.
Getting a sense of how you are Very often we don&amp;rsquo;t stop enough to take stock of how we&amp;rsquo;re really doing.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been reflecting on the last year and a bit of working back in engineering management, and have a few posts that I‚Äôd like to share. These are things that would have helped me to hear when I was starting out for the first time, so I‚Äôm writing particularly for people thinking about becoming a manager. The first one is about friendships and support as a manager.
Returning to management was a change for me on a few fronts.</description>

      <description>Happy new year! It‚Äôs that time again - the Christmas break is drawing to a close, and I‚Äôve got some headspace to look back on what the year has held.
This year I‚Äôve decided to split my annual reflections into two posts: one looking back over the last 12 months, and another over the decade. This is the first, and it covers rare infections, work, and more. As always I&amp;rsquo;m writing to document everything for myself first and foremost, but if you&amp;rsquo;re interested grab a tea, it‚Äôs a long read.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s not often that I hear about an emerging web standard and I find my mind wandering back to it over the next few days, but Web Monetization has done just that. In this post I&#39;ll go through what it is, and why I think it&#39;s particularly interesting.
Last weekend I was speaking at State of the Browser, where the always delightful (and impeccably dressed) Bruce Lawson was on before me.</description>

      <description>Life as a manager means that I go to a lot of meetings. Over time it&#39;s very easy for them to get a bit unruly, and for your calendar to start managing you rather than the other way round. Every now and again I&#39;ve found it&#39;s good to take stock, to tip everything out and start again, in the form of a calendar defrag. Here&#39;s how I approach it, and a tool you can use if you&#39;d like to join me.</description>

      <description>Since joining Monzo as an engineering manager at the start of December I&#39;ve experienced a huge amount. In this post I wanted to capture some of what I&#39;ve been up to, and what I&#39;m looking forward to next.
I got an email from an old client recently, asking (amongst other things!) &amp;ldquo;Is Monzo working out?&amp;quot;. My reply was the same as it always is ‚Äì I honestly couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with my work than I am at the moment.</description>

      <description>Since returning to employee status I&#39;ve been thrown back into having an absolutely stacked calendar. Over the last couple of weeks I&#39;ve been playing with an emoji-based system to help me work better.
A lot of people have written a lot of things about ways to manage busy calendars, often using colour to help visually differentiate between types of tasks. Whilst I&amp;rsquo;ve found this useful, it helped me even more to have an additional visual classification system thrown into the mix: emoji.</description>

      <description>This week I received the very happy news that I&#39;d passed my second Japanese exam - the JLPT (otherwise known as Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûËÉΩÂäõË©¶È®ì) at level N4. In this post I&#39;ll outline my exam experiences and go through the resources I used.
Since writing my first post on this subject, I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed hearing from others who&amp;rsquo;d got in touch to let me know that they&amp;rsquo;d found it useful. Despite that post only being written last August I&amp;rsquo;ve found that quite a few of my habits have changed as I&amp;rsquo;ve levelled up, so passing the exam seemed like a good benchmark for documenting what I do now.</description>

      <description>I really enjoy this time of year. Christmas is always a bit of a whirlwind due to numerous individual family gatherings and birthdays, but New Year is always a nice lull. As always I‚Äôm using a blog post as a prompt to look both back and ahead.
 My instagram top nine is an interesting take on my annual highlights!  2018 and health Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the rubbish stuff. This year was hard in a lot of ways that I hadn‚Äôt experienced before.</description>

My role will be in Engineering Management, and I‚Äôll be supporting the growth, progression, performance, and wellbeing of everyone I‚Äôll be managing, even as they move onto different features or projects. üîúüë©üèª‚Äçüíª</description>

      <description>Most of the work that I do can be boiled down to trying to help people make better things with the web, in better ways. ‚ÄòBetter‚Äô is a nice vague term, isn‚Äôt it? In this case ‚Äòbetter‚Äô can mean things like faster, cheaper, or more effectively, but it can also mean cutting-edge, delightful, more ethical, or even simply happier. It‚Äôs a nice mix.
I‚Äôve spoken often about the importance of having a balanced view of change - of how simply swapping one technology for another won‚Äôt magically solve all of your problems - but this also goes hand in hand with another truth: in this day and age how you work with technology plays a huge part in the success of whatever you‚Äôre trying to do.</description>

      <description>The other day I saw a call on social media from the lovely Jo Franchetti, asking for people‚Äôs views on web permissions to take into a W3C workshop.
This is a subject that I think is really important. It‚Äôs a wonderful melting pot of technical aspects meeting user experience; of developer experience and browser capabilities merging with website creators‚Äô visions.
The web gaining ever-more functionality and exciting possibilities is something that benefits both the people that make it, and the people that use it.</description>

      <description>Since the beginning of this year I&#39;ve been taking my Japanese learning a lot more seriously. Having been asked about it by quite a few people, this post is intended to summarise my journey so far.
My starting point(s) I first started to &amp;lsquo;learn&amp;rsquo; Japanese in 2008 before my first trip, but that consisted of buying a phrasebook and copying a things into my omni-present notebook (these were the dark days before Google Translate).</description>

      <description>This is the second post in a two-part series, capturing my latest trip over to Japan. You can find part one here, talking about more general aspects of the trip. In this post I&#39;ll be talking about the main reason for our visit - EVO.
„ÅÑ„Å£„Å°„ÇáÔºÅARMSÔºÅ The Evolution Championship Series, or EVO for short is an esports, fighting game tournament series. This was the first time that it had come to Japan, and as such was a great opportunity for people to attend the event in a country where you can find an arcade almost everywhere (as we found in the basement of Atami Castle last year).</description>

      <description>In January I headed back to Japan, jumping on the opportunity to spend more time in a country that I love. The trip was prompted by my husband competing at EVO Japan 2018, but ended up being so much more. In these two posts I&#39;ll talk about the trip in general, and the event itself.
EVO Japan (an esports, fighting game tournament event within the EVO series) first came up last year, coincidentally when we were in Shinjuku on the final leg of our honeymoon.</description>

It all started with Dan Hon.

On Monday I was coming home from London on the train, and Dan popped up on Twitter with his latest creation: &amp;ldquo;I trained an A.</description>

      <description>We‚Äôve started the process of redesigning and redeveloping the OpenActive website, and as part of trying to do this openly we‚Äôd like to ask for your initial thoughts. Please note that this article was previously written for the OpenActive blog as part of my role on the project as an Open Data Institute Associate, and is recorded here for posterity.  For anyone reading this who may be new to the world of open opportunity data (or who needs a brief ‚Äòpreviously on OpenActive‚Äô refresher), here‚Äôs the story so far:</description>

      <description>Render Conference is a two day, single track conference held in the beautiful city of Oxford, which is billed as a ‚Äúconference for front-end developers‚Äù but actually manages to pack in so much more. Earlier this year, an email popped up on my screen, titled ‚ÄúInvitation to speak at Render Conference 2017 as our closing Keynote‚Äù. It was a lovely introduction, asking me to give a talk along the lines of one I‚Äôd done last year.</description>

      <description>At the end of 2015 I‚Äôd been really struggling: the stress of living on a building site for a year and my sleep/sanity waning; desperately trying to move house to get away but the chain collapsing numerous times; brain tumours and subsequent travel uncertainty. It all led to a place where my work and health were suffering hugely. My summary blog post reflected this ‚Äì it was very gloomy and full of frustration.</description>

A good marker to start thinking about this may be when you‚Äôre regularly getting more enquiries than you can deal with alone (and want to scale ‚Äì staying as you are is ok too if you‚Äôre happy!</description>

As only three questions make it into the magazine I asked whether I‚Äôd be able to publish the answers that didn‚Äôt make the cut or were too long. This post is the first of two, in which I‚Äôll be sharing my answers that weren‚Äôt in the mag.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year¬†I was in London, discussing Pok√©mon Go with a colleague. The game wasn‚Äôt officially out in the UK but had already flooded our¬†social media channels, and I was adamant that I wasn‚Äôt going to get involved. It wasn‚Äôt a good idea. I have certain compulsive tendencies around collecting within games, and after I‚Äôd finally weaned myself off the Lego series (smash everything, collect all the studs, 100% the games), I decided that I really, probably shouldn‚Äôt start trying to Catch ‚ÄòEm All.</description>

      <description>15 years ago, my personal school and Sixth Form experience of being taught anything related to computers (or &amp;#8216;ICT&amp;#8217; as it was at the time) was at best a mixed experience. Like many my age, I fell into the gap of having an interest and knowing that there was more that could be done with these wonderful grey boxes that lined our classrooms, but being provided instead with a curriculum¬†that wasn&amp;#8217;t reflective of what was happening out in the &amp;#8216;real&amp;#8217; world.</description>

      <description>Over the past year and a bit, if you follow me anywhere online you‚Äôll probably have seen some references to the torturous time I‚Äôve been having trying to move house. Back in July 2015 I wrote about my experience of getting a mortgage whilst self-employed, and having finally exchanged I feel that I can now tell the tale of another aspect &amp;#8211; using an ‚Äòonline‚Äô estate agent. This digitisation of a much-berated industry has gathered immense speed over the last couple of years, coming with the major benefit of claiming to potentially save you thousands over traditional agency fees.</description>

      <description>Throughout 2015 I did quite a few talks on data, or more specifically the concept of open data. During this time I was continuing to undertake a data project of my own &amp;#8211; something that I had habitually woven into my daily routines &amp;#8211; the act of logging all of my tea drinking using a side project called Tea Tracker that I made at the end of 2013. My original post on the subject explained the background of the project and how it was built.</description>

      <description>In one of those &amp;#8216;blog about it so I don&amp;#8217;t forget later&amp;#8217; moments, today I happened to discover something that shouldn&amp;#8217;t have surprised me, but which could be pretty useful in the right circumstances &amp;#8211; the ability to introduce live Google translations into a spreadsheet. I‚Äôm currently working on a project which involves stakeholders from France and Germany as well as the UK. This afternoon I was sent over a spreadsheet of feedback in xslx format, all in German, and considered the best way to¬†make this understandable to my teammates.</description>

      <description>Walking off stage, my body was processing the usual adrenaline rush and come down combo, I was sweating profusely, and my throat was sore from all of the previous days&amp;#8217; practice and the final delivery.

      <description>Last week was a busy one. Amongst some work with¬†the ODI¬†that we‚Äôre doing for the BBC, I also spoke at an event called The Digital Pond one evening.
The Digital Pond is a free meetup, and this one was titled ‚ÄòResponding To The Responsive Web:¬†Insights On Reshaping User Experience‚Äò. I had the pleasure of catching up with fellow Pond speaker¬†Jeremy Keith, and was glad that unlike our first meeting back in June, this time around I was less of a nervous wreck about speaking and could actually process enough words to have a better chat.</description>

      <description>One of the things I‚Äôm very keen on is being open about the realities of freelancing. Even though I‚Äôm over a year and a half in, I‚Äôm always eager¬†to read pieces that others have shared on the matter, whether they‚Äôre about the realities of business, how people work, or just general freelancer musings, because they really help me learn. I‚Äôm keen to share the details of my experiences with others for that reason.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm reading Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson at the moment, and came across this passage that I particularly liked.
 ‚ÄúWhen I was fifteen years old, I missed a period. My boyfriend and I were using a diaphragm, but I knew it was fallible. I was good at math, I had the failure rate memorized, burnt into my subconscious. Or maybe it was my conscious, I can never keep them straight.</description>

      <description>The other week, my friend Paul Swain happened to mention that he was finally getting round to transferring some of his old blog posts over to his current site. Paul used to have a WordPress-based site, but switched over to Kirby when he redesigned it a while back.
His situation struck a bit of a chord with me ‚Äì my first blog-based site had been built using ColdFusion and the BlogCFC component, but at one point during a redesign I‚Äôd switched to WordPress.</description>

      <description>For anyone who has perhaps been at some kind of hipster wilderness retreat for the last couple of months, you may not have noticed that the 20th FIFA World Cup was held in Brazil recently. Last night not only marked the final match of the tournament, but also meant the conclusion of my run of ‚ÄòWorld Cup Dinners‚Äô.
I have a love/hate relationship with football. Love, because it‚Äôs great. From playing barefoot in the garden, putting cross after cross in to my brother (or a tree if he wasn‚Äôt available), to playing at a fairly decent level during school, to now sporadic kick arounds in parks, I‚Äôve always loved playing.</description>

      <description>Last week I finally finished the game Watch Dogs, at least to the point where the main story was done. I found the whole experience overall quite frustrating, and wanted to share some thoughts on the subject of attention to detail, and how little touches can make a huge difference to people‚Äôs enjoyment of using your product.
What‚Äôs this Watch Dogs thing then? Watch Dogs is ‚Äúan open world action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft‚Äù ‚Äì thanks Wikipedia.</description>

      <description>After a thoroughly brilliant long weekend of conference fun, I was finally back on a train this morning, racing via inevitable delays and route alterations back to the land of Essex. It seemed like as good a time as any to take up Jeremy Keith‚Äôs closing call to arms, and to share my experiences of the wonderful Responsive Day Out 2, so here is the story of my time in Brighton.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve recently done something that I‚Äôve been considering for a while, which is to write and publish an ebook. The result of this was¬†Atomic Documentation, and I¬†released it last week. As with a lot of things that I do, part of it¬†was to overcome a fear. I frequently find myself being guilty of wanting to write something or make something, but then bail on actually putting it out there.</description>

      <description>As part of my fast-approaching¬†presentation at Responsive Day Out 2 I‚Äôm (spoilers!) going to be talking very briefly about the upcoming light-level (formerly luminosity)¬†media query, amongst other much more important things like Batman.
The talk is only 15-20 minutes long so there‚Äôs only so much detail that I can go into with everything, and I wanted to put a bit more information and context in this post.
Please note that since I started writing my talk this had all changed (as is the fun of draft specs).</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been working from home a lot recently, and the primary reason (outside of my extreme train grumpiness) is that since the start of the year I‚Äôve been trying to coordinate being here so that I can bring home some¬†kittens. The hope is that by being here daily I can settle them in, and attempt to stop them from causing absolute carnage amongst the assortment of brightly coloured, kitten mouth-sized toys that adorn the shelves and surfaces throughout my house.</description>

      <description>Whilst skimming through my Twitter feed a while ago, I dropped out of the stream quickly to read a post that had been tweeted by Kotaku, the well-known gaming blog. The post caught my eye because it was about Mass Effect, one of my all-time favourite gaming series, but it ended up prompting a deeper thought.
The blog post covered the story of some free DLC that had been released a couple of years ago for the final game in the series.</description>

      <description>More news! Unless anything else comes up that I can‚Äôt turn down, my speaking in 2014 looks like it will be rounded off nicely by a trip out to Bologna to talk at From the Front conference in September. I know I always say this (because it‚Äôs true), but I‚Äôm really looking forward to this one. It‚Äôs a completely different kind of excitement to Responsive Day Out 2, because: There‚Äôs an Indiana Jones theme, which presumably means I can walk the whole time¬†wearing my Indy hat all week, quoting Indy quotes.</description>

      <description>Yes folks, it‚Äôs that time again. Every now and again I get the urge to make something (usually pretty pointless), and the latest in this series of wonderful distractions is Tea Tracker.
This was actually born way back, in November last year. At the time I was hopping around on trains a lot, and it started as yet another way of keeping my brain from melting by doing something semi-productive. For quite some time I‚Äôd been meaning to create a project to keep track of my tea drinking, because it‚Äôs the kind of amazingly nerdy thing that fascinates me.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I promised myself that I‚Äôd at least try to work with certain people that I was really interested in and was passionate about, either because of the subject matter or the nature of the work that they were doing. As a one-(wo)man-band it‚Äôs often quite hard to get a foot in the door with people who just don‚Äôt want to speak to anyone but full service agencies, or don‚Äôt publish lines of communication, but I‚Äôm a firm believer in things not happening unless you try.</description>

      <description>At the start of this year I was over in New York. It was a long weekend away, and despite it being an East Coast timezone rather than the West of my recent trips stateside, I was pretty horribly jetlagged. Waking up ridiculously early usually meant an hour lounging around in bed, finding local diner locations to hit up for breakfast, checking some emails and catching up on everything that had happened in the rest of the world whilst my time- travelling body had slept.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve been considering forming a limited company to operate under for quite a while now, and this weekend I finally went and did it. I thought I‚Äôd put together a quick post for anyone in a similar boat.
Why go limited? As I‚Äôve documented previously, I started out as a sole trader under the slight self-misbelief that I‚Äôd ‚Äúfreelance for a while until I found the right proper job‚Äù. Being a sole trader seemed to make sense in that mindset, although my accountant did mention right from the start that I may want to consider forming a company if things really took off.</description>

      <description>A friend and ex-colleague of mine,¬†Paul Swain, recently wrote a quick little post called ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pissing in my pond now‚Äú, which was around his thoughts on the matter of the IT departments and legacy systems that frequently hamper him during his work as Head of User Experience at The Unit in Brighton.
Paul and I have had many discussions over the years on this matter, and worked together on a particularly challenging project where the IT systems and teams were at the core of all decisions being made.</description>

      <description>Anyone who has hit a brick wall with their vocabulary and resorted to summoning a thesaurus, has probably experienced that picking an apparently synonymous word can actually result in a totally different message.
For example, according to thesaurus.com, if searching for a new way to declare my love for someone, I could end up with the following:
‚ÄúI love you‚Äù
‚ÄúI lust you‚Äù
‚ÄúI fondness you‚Äù
‚ÄúI respect you‚Äù

      <description>Quite possibly my favourite thing about freelancing is the ability to control my own ability to take time off. In the last couple of years of being an employee I did some notable 6-8 month stints without a day off, and unsurprisingly it was really not very good for me. Spending time in other parts of the world is something that I really love, and one of my aims has been to make the most of being in charge of my own schedule.</description>

      <description>Coming to the end of my full-time job at the end of 2012 was a sad but exciting time. It was the end of an era for me, and I was very sorry not to be working with some great people any more, but was also excited about what lay ahead.
Working on a contract basis I now often have the same feeling, but in more regular bursts. As much as I may have enjoyed a particular project of working with a certain company, moving on always marks the start of something exciting for me, and is something that I really enjoy.</description>

      <description>When starting out with your own business, getting the accounting side of things right can be a big headache. I initially started out using some very basic spreadsheets and pretty InDesign invoices, but as I‚Äôve documented in previous posts I eventually migrated to FreeAgent, which has been absolutely brilliant for me.
Custom invoice templates FreeAgent, amongst being all-round useful, allows you to customise your invoices with very basic CSS skills. They offer several pre-built templates, but I wanted to be sending something which designed up nicely, and matched my brand a bit better than the defaults.</description>

      <description>This is continuation of part one, part two and part 3, a series of posts summarising what I have learnt from my first year of freelancing, in the hope that my experiences will help others considering something similar. This post discusses continuing your learning as a freelancer, and conferences.
Learning Something that I believe in particularly strongly is that you need to be responsible for your own personal progress, and have the drive to better yourself.</description>

      <description>Back in March this year I attended the Responsive Day Out, a conference curated by Clearleft in Brighton. One of the themes throughout the day, and a message which was summed up by Jeremy Keith in the closing moments, was that we need to share more. Sharing shouldn‚Äôt just be about our successes and the things we do right, but we should also ensure that we share our difficulties too, so that others can learn from them.</description>

In their words, ‚ÄúSmart folk collaborating and experimenting to solve stuff that matters‚Äù.
We met on the Friday evening to kick off a ‚Äô24 hour gig‚Äô ‚Äì a hackathon over the Friday night and Saturday daytime to help three local causes with everything from websites to social media to posters.</description>

      <description>I had the great pleasure of speaking at LWC 2013 in Shoreditch, London yesterday for my last speaking gig of 2013. It was a fantastic day, full of absolutely lovely people and some brilliant talks. In a happy coincidence a lot of the talks had similar themes and messages, and I was very grateful to be amongst such great speakers. Big thanks to Mint Digital and all of the organisers for putting together something that ran so well, to the other speakers for being so interesting, and for everyone who attended for being so receptive and great to talk to.</description>

When I heard that the site was being opened up to general submissions, I came home, sat on the sofa, and promptly emptied my head of some thoughts that had been swimming around inside it for a few days. As with all good musings it had started out as a pub chat, this one occurring with a friend during an incredibly bland England match, and I had originally intended to capture the sentiment in a blog post at some point.</description>

      <description>After speaking at Adobe MAX in May and Scotch on the Rocks in June earlier this year I needed a bit of a pause on the speaking front. I‚Äôd started a new contract, work was becoming incredibly busy, and I‚Äôd started getting lots of speaking doubts around the time of Scotch which had made for some sleepless nights. I was actually contacted about a brilliant opportunity shortly after, which part of me is still kicking myself for not going after, but I felt I needed to focus on the day job and come back to speaking later once I had some better formed ideas.</description>

It&amp;#8217;s a simple site, with minimal CMS requirements, and once we&amp;#8217;d pinned down the content requirements, defined the data types, and talked about what they wanted to manage, I went ahead and built the functional side of things pretty quickly.

      <description>BattleBlock Theatre, the latest output by The Behemoth, is equal parts brilliant, cutesy platformer fun vs mind boggling frustration.
Anyone who has been in close proximity to me whilst playing anything will tell you that I am a sweary gamer. I frequently talk out loud. I call collections of pixels all manner of obscenities, and my virtual demise is usually met with some very creative combinations of words. Considering that my deaths count on BBT currently stands at 1549 (and rapidly rising) you can imagine the sort of language that has been pouring out of my living room recently.</description>

      <description>Over the Christmas holidays I took advantage of an Xbox Live Arcade deal where Episode One of Telltale Games‚Äô The Walking Dead series had been put up for free download. I was looking forward to this, as it had got some great reviews from friends who were playing through the series. I had however received a singular note of caution from another trusted reviewer, one which turned out to be entirely accurate.</description>

      <description>Having got a¬†Raspberry Pi¬†for Christmas, up until today it had been sat in its original bag when it wasn‚Äôt being used. As such I decided to follow in the tradition of DIY cases and make an initial temporary case for the Pi out of Lego to give it a proper home and to hopefully reduce the likelihood of me mishandling it/getting tea on it/breaking it.
Using the remains of a 1999¬†Sith Infiltrator, and what could only have been a¬†Creator Prehistoric Power¬†set along with other bricks in my spares box, I was able to come up with the above.</description>

      <description>So it‚Äôs this time of year again. It really doesn‚Äôt feel like another year has been and gone, but as with last year it also feels like an awful lot has changed in the last 12 months.
So what happened in 2012? As in 2011, 2012 brought another role change, this time to Head of Technology. The change was in more than responsibilities. My focus shifted throughout the year as the importance of consultancy and strategy grew within the business.</description>

      <description>I downloaded the Xbox SmartGlass app for Android a while ago, but hadn‚Äôt got around to actually trying it until a couple of days ago.
For those of you who don‚Äôt know what SmartGlass is, it ‚Äúturns your mobile phone or tablet into a second screen that intelligently interacts with your Xbox 360 to elevate your entertainment experience‚Äù ‚Äì¬†http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/smartglass.
I wanted to do something simple ‚Äì sign in and check my messages ‚Äì so I loaded up the app and after a rather nice, clean loading animation I was presented with the sign in screen.</description>

      <description>As I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all aware, there‚Äôs yet another End of the World prediction for the 21st December. Dear readers, I would like to put your minds at ease, and say that whilst the date of the prediction is indeed accurate, as with all of these things the meaning has been misinterpreted over time. I‚Äôd like to take this opportunity to clear everything up ‚Äì the Mayans were right and the 21st will indeed mark the end of a great age, but it will mark the last time I am in the office as an employee of Lightmaker (*small print official last day 24th, working from home) rather than fiery deaths for us all.</description>

      <description>As announced¬†previously on this blog, last Tuesday I was very pleased to be able to speak at the London leg of Adobe‚Äôs Create The Web tour.
My session was ‚ÄòAn introduction to the modern web for the creative professional‚Äô, a 45 minute talk which aimed to cover an overview of HTML5 and associated technologies, including some examples around its use within the industry.
Despite the venue having some technical issues I had a great time on the day and really enjoyed giving the presentation and being part of the event.</description>

      <description>Last night Adobe showed off some of the new things they‚Äôve been working on in the form of a live streamed session from their Create The Web keynote in San Francisco.
Highlights of this for me was the work they are doing to progress CSS3 in the form of their¬†CSS FilterLab, along with the evolution of tools I‚Äôm already using and love, such as Shadow, which has now joined the suite of ‚ÄòEdge‚Äô tools and services.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, when headed to London alone one evening, I took with me a couple of headshots and scribbled notes about people that I was hoping to bump into that night. I wasn‚Äôt out on some kind of hitman mission (well, I would say that‚Ä¶), but instead was heading to an industry event which some interesting people I‚Äôd previously spoken to on twitter were happening to attend.
Doing this took me back to my past, when I‚Äôd lived a mis-spent youth making friends with people that I knew off the internet.</description>

Not writing about technology for once, this piece is instead about one of my other interests ‚Äì the world of designer toys. Before I started working from home my Lightmaker desk was absolutely covered with vinyl figures, but due to the practicalities of a few too many desk moves and less time spent actually at my work desk over the last year these have now all been migrated to my home office.</description>

Working with clients to identify the options available to them, and discussing why certain approaches may be more feasible than others should be an important part of all new projects.

      <description>At Lightmaker, our strategic work often revolves around gathering the opinions of others and feeding these into our plans for projects. Whether stakeholders or users, asking the right questions and opening topics up to discussion can often help uncover views that would otherwise have been missed.
When working on internal business strategy I think it‚Äôs important to bear the same principles in mind, and as such I recently carried out a survey of all UK studio staff in order to get their opinions on technical change.</description>

      <description>Developers hate inefficiencies. We hate repetitive tasks. We hate having to re-type something we‚Äôve not 30 seconds ago typed in on a different device, especially considering we‚Äôre likely surrounded by about 10 of the damn things. This is why I love Adobe Shadow.
Adobe Shadow is a new inspection and preview tool which aims to remove some of the common pains of the present day development workflow. Mobile is a given for new projects nowadays, and since it‚Äôs preferable to view output on real devices rather than emulators it‚Äôs easy to end up in a situation where time and patience is wasted on frequently refreshing a sea of devices littering your desk.</description>

      <description>It was announced last week that the UK government will be replacing the current Information and Communications Technology curriculum with that of a Computer Science focused course.
In a move that has been strongly welcomed by the development community, it will mean a dramatic about turn from this time last year when the government were thenconsidering making ICT a non-compulsory part of the curriculum.
As someone who studied ICT throughout my school life, taking qualifications at GCSE level (age 14-16), then IT at AS and A-Level (age 16-18) I think that this is a great move.</description>

This year has been incredibly busy, both personally and professionally, and has been unlike anything previous. There have been some amazing highlights, but it has all come after an awful lot of hard work, and I‚Äôve learnt a lot of tough lessons about what¬†not¬†to do.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I made the tough decision to commit to moving out of Kent, and up to East Anglia. This obviously tied into decisions about my working life, which up until that point had revolved around heading in to the office in Tunbridge Wells every day for the last 6 years. After some very honest chats with the directors at Lightmaker, it was decided that both parties would give me working remotely a chance.</description>

This was my first MAX, and was something which I have been looking forward to for a long time. Having never been to a conference outside of the UK I was unsure what to expect from a lot of things.</description>

      <description>Like most people, hearing about Google+ last week caused me to immediately sign up to be invited to the Beta. Shortly after I was lucky enough to be sent an invite using a well known loophole, and took it upon myself to start shooting out invites to friends, colleagues and family members in an attempt to start filling my circles with fellow users.
After using G+ (yeah, I‚Äôm on that naming convention bandwagon) for a week, I thought I‚Äôd write up some thoughts on the service now I‚Äôve had some time for it to settle down.</description>

      <description>Today brought the announcement of Adobe‚Äôs first mid-cycle release for Creative Suite 5.5. Instead of continuing with uninterrupted milestone releases, these will be moved to a two-year cycle, with mid-cycle releases keeping the product relevant and at the cutting edge of technology.
There were two main sides to the announcement ‚Äì functionality and licensing.
Licensing So is this just a ploy by Adobe to take our money more regularly? Quite the opposite ‚Äì one of Adobe‚Äôs big changes has been the introduction of a Subscription Edition in order to make upgrading more affordable and more suited to users‚Äô fluctuating usage scenarios.</description>

      <description>As Solutions Architect some of the core elements of my job are to keep up-to-date with new developments within the industry, to advise my organisation and clients about technical strategy, and make recommendations, whether that be on a project basis or as part of more general business strategy. Because of this, I was very interested when I learned that Terrence Ryan had written a book on Driving Technical Change.
The book‚Äôs subtitle is ‚ÄúWhy People On Your Team Don‚Äôt Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should‚Äù, and is likely to strike a chord with many ‚Äì on reading this simple statement alone several encounters came to mind, and I‚Äôm sure that others have experienced a similar reaction.</description>

      <description>After three non-stop days of travel, keynotes, sessions, and networking, Scotch on the Rocks is now over for another year. The quality of the speakers this year was first class, and that coupled with an excellent venue and a brilliant community made for what I consider to be the best Scotch yet.
The conference was held at the Apex International Hotel in Edinburgh, and with the majority of attendees staying either in the International or its neighbouring sister hotel the Apex City it ensured that there was always a large contingent of people to chat to at any time of the day or night.</description>

      <description>As I‚Äôll be attending¬†Scotch on the Rocks¬†(Europe‚Äôs premier ColdFusion-based conference) next week, this weekend will be all about getting ready for the long voyage from the safety of Kent to the wilds of Edinburgh.
If you‚Äôre anything like me, conferences will be booked up months in advance and will rapidly descend on you when you‚Äôre completely booked up with a sea of various other things to think about. For my own future reference, as well as for anyone travelling to conferences or other business-related gatherings, here‚Äôs my preparation checklist.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôm very proud to be able to say that I have been accepted as an Adobe Community Professional for 2011. It‚Äôs a big honour to be included into the ranks alongside people that I respect an incredible amount, so I‚Äôd like to say a massive thank you to Adobe, and to the individual that recommended me for inclusion in the first place.
This year there are only 234 ACPs worldwide, with an additional 87 ACCs.</description>

      <description>So here we are ‚Äì 2011, and starting it with no resolutions as such, but instead a list of things that I think would be good for me, or that I‚Äôd like to try. One such thing is starting a proper blog‚Ä¶ and sticking to it!
Firstly, on a serious note, the whole blogging thing is actually something I‚Äôve had to put a lot of thought into in terms of balancing my voice as an individual against that of my employer.</description>
