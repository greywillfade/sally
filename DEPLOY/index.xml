      <description>To help break this down, I’ve put together a series of prompts that you may find useful, whether for asking yourself as an individual or used in a different capacity, like in 1:1s with reports.
Getting a sense of how you are Very often we don&amp;rsquo;t stop enough to take stock of how we&amp;rsquo;re really doing. If you&amp;rsquo;re responsible for other people in some capacity, as a parent, carer, or manager, you may also find yourself thinking more about the wellbeing of the people you&amp;rsquo;re looking after.</description>

      <title>The loneliness of management</title>

      <description>Returning to management was a change for me on a few fronts. Not only was I headed back to a role that I hadn’t been doing in this form for many years, but I was also employed again. As a consultant I&amp;rsquo;d become used to being a bit of an outsider, but as an employee I’d previously enjoyed being part of something; to have friends to go to the pub with or form gaming clans, some of whom had grown to be best friends even to this day.</description>

      <description>This year I’ve decided to split my annual reflections into two posts: one looking back over the last 12 months, and another over the decade. This is the first, and it covers rare infections, work, and more. As always I&amp;rsquo;m writing to document everything for myself first and foremost, but if you&amp;rsquo;re interested grab a tea, it’s a long read.
2019 was another exceptionally hard year Coming off the back of a 2018 where I’d felt physically extremely limited by my thyroid condition, I was optimistic for 2019 and raring to get back to normality.</description>

      <description>Last weekend I was speaking at State of the Browser, where the always delightful (and impeccably dressed) Bruce Lawson was on before me. As ever Bruce gave us a great talk, but it was the last section about his recent consultancy work that really got my brain ticking over. He&amp;rsquo;d been doing some work with a company called Coil, who are backing the creation of a new web standard around a JavaScript API which allows the creation of a payment stream from the user agent to a website: Web Monetization.</description>

      <description>Early on when I started at Monzo, my manager, Will, shared a spreadsheet with me. In his version there was a representation of two work weeks, with cells for individual time slots. The idea was to be able to lay out what you have going on (or could have), before rebooking your meetings to gain some headspace. Over the months I&amp;rsquo;ve built on Will&amp;rsquo;s initial template, and you can find my curent version here: Calendar defragger template</description>

      <description>I got an email from an old client recently, asking (amongst other things!) &amp;ldquo;Is Monzo working out?&amp;quot;. My reply was the same as it always is – I honestly couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier with my work than I am at the moment. It needed something pretty special to take me away from self-employment, and if anything being at Monzo has completely exceeded my expectations, both in terms of the opportunities that I&amp;rsquo;ve already been given, and the company culture itself.</description>

      <description>A lot of people have written a lot of things about ways to manage busy calendars, often using colour to help visually differentiate between types of tasks. Whilst I&amp;rsquo;ve found this useful, it helped me even more to have an additional visual classification system thrown into the mix: emoji.
At Monzo we use emoji a lot. Partly because they&amp;rsquo;re fun, and partly because they can be genuinely useful communication aids. We have a set of &amp;ldquo;semantic emoji&amp;rdquo; for Slack, to help people quickly parse the context of messages being shared.</description>

      <description>Since writing my first post on this subject, I&amp;rsquo;ve really enjoyed hearing from others who&amp;rsquo;d got in touch to let me know that they&amp;rsquo;d found it useful. Despite that post only being written last August I&amp;rsquo;ve found that quite a few of my habits have changed as I&amp;rsquo;ve levelled up, so passing the exam seemed like a good benchmark for documenting what I do now.
Before I leap into resources, I&amp;rsquo;ll cover my exam experience, and what I think it means to go from N5 to N4.</description>

      <description>2018 and health Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the rubbish stuff. This year was hard in a lot of ways that I hadn’t experienced before. For the first time in my life, I got to a point where I felt debilitated and restricted by my heath. I’ve always been lucky enough to have no kind of disability, but increasingly I’d battled with getting very, very tired. There was a subtle reference to this in last year’s goals, with “To continue to try to look after myself, with exercise, good food, and sleep and rest when I need it.</description>

      <description>My role will be in Engineering Management, and I’ll be supporting the growth, progression, performance, and wellbeing of everyone I’ll be managing, even as they move onto different features or projects. 🔜👩🏻‍💻
It’s almost exactly 6 years since I left my role as Head of Technology at Lightmaker in pursuit of new experiences (and less of a hellish drive to Kent), and accidentally fell into working for myself. I didn’t enter self-employment with any of the recommended safety nets — my plan was to have a nice long break and then start speaking to companies, freelancing until I found the ’right’ thing — but I instantly loved it and never looked back.</description>

      <description>I’ve spoken often about the importance of having a balanced view of change - of how simply swapping one technology for another won’t magically solve all of your problems - but this also goes hand in hand with another truth: in this day and age how you work with technology plays a huge part in the success of whatever you’re trying to do.
A lot of my projects start of by capturing an view of how things are at the moment, and there are an absolute ton of ways to do that.</description>

      <description>The other day I saw a call on social media from the lovely Jo Franchetti, asking for people’s views on web permissions to take into a W3C workshop.
This is a subject that I think is really important. It’s a wonderful melting pot of technical aspects meeting user experience; of developer experience and browser capabilities merging with website creators’ visions.
The web gaining ever-more functionality and exciting possibilities is something that benefits both the people that make it, and the people that use it.</description>

      <description>My starting point(s) I first started to &amp;lsquo;learn&amp;rsquo; Japanese in 2008 before my first trip, but that consisted of buying a phrasebook and copying a things into my omni-present notebook (these were the dark days before Google Translate). I learnt how to parrot a bit, but once I got back home everything stopped. My next visit was 2010, and at that point I got a CD to listen to in my car as I was doing a ton of driving.</description>

      <description>いっちょ！ARMS！ The Evolution Championship Series, or EVO for short is an esports, fighting game tournament series. This was the first time that it had come to Japan, and as such was a great opportunity for people to attend the event in a country where you can find an arcade almost everywhere (as we found in the basement of Atami Castle last year).
Our trip started to shift into EVO-mode when we first met up with Defur in Harajuku, then collected Esthri the following day from Tokyo station.</description>

      <description>EVO Japan (an esports, fighting game tournament event within the EVO series) first came up last year, coincidentally when we were in Shinjuku on the final leg of our honeymoon. My husband had been playing the Nintendo Switch game ARMS for some time, and had formed some good friendships from the community around it. He&amp;rsquo;d contributed to some player crowdfunding, and was musing about how much fun some people would be having.</description>

      <description>Life Let’s start with the important bit - life.
My 2016 summary post talked about a shifting mentality to take a bit more control, and doing things that were important to me in both work and my personal life. This continued in 2017, which in all honesty has felt like the first year where work took a little bit less of my focus. Coming off the back of such a professionally successful 2016 I’ve found this a little bit difficult to square away with myself at times, but on the other hand I wouldn’t change a thing.</description>

On Monday I was coming home from London on the train, and Dan popped up on Twitter with his latest creation: &amp;ldquo;I trained an A.I. to write Star Trek episode titles&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>A shifting focus Our Phase 1 goals for OpenActive centred primarily around awareness of what the initiative is trying to achieve, and getting people to start making their data openly available for anyone to use, reuse and share. The website reflected this, with most content focusing on the publication of data and sharing the development of the evolving standards. Lists of data were very much that — big, bold, logos that visually showcased the growing momentum of people joining in.</description>

      <description>For anyone reading this who may be new to the world of open opportunity data (or who needs a brief ‘previously on OpenActive’ refresher), here’s the story so far:
OpenActive is a community-led initiative of sport and physical activity member organisations and individuals, using open data to help people get active. We’re working on areas like:
 Improving access to opportunity data (data about where and when sport and physical activities happen) Helping people to make things with data, to meet society’s digital expectations Developing open standards Building data literacy within the sector Working collaboratively to evoke change across the sector  OpenActive is stewarded by the Open Data Institute (ODI), supported by Sport England and formed of member organisations and individuals in the sport and physical activity sector who share a vision to help people get active by stimulating use and innovation with open data.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year, an email popped up on my screen, titled “Invitation to speak at Render Conference 2017 as our closing Keynote”. It was a lovely introduction, asking me to give a talk along the lines of one I’d done last year. This was perfect timing for me, as whilst I’m not looking to do a huge amount of speaking this year, I was looking for an excuse to put together a new talk more focused on the recent digital transformation work that I’d been doing, and what this means for our approach to web projects.</description>

      <description>My summary blog postreflected this – it was very gloomy and full of frustration. Thankfully, this year (personally rather than globally!) has been very different.
We finally managed to move house in February, a year after our house went on the market. Right up to the end it was exhausting – another hard deadline, and exchange was attempted every day for a week but failed to happen each time for a different reason, so we were at complete breaking point.</description>

      <description>How do you know when it’s time to hire your first employee? Asked by Sasha Endoh
A good marker to start thinking about this may be when you’re regularly getting more enquiries than you can deal with alone (and want to scale – staying as you are is ok too if you’re happy!), or when you’re regularly feeling the need to bring in specialist skill sets other than your own. Perhaps you’ve frequently had to bring in a freelancer to help with a very particular job, and this has happened on every project over the last 12 months.</description>

      <description>If you’re interested, you can find my three answered questions in printed form in the magazine. These were: &amp;ldquo;How do you remedy the isolation of working alone or in a small team?&amp;quot;, &amp;ldquo;Is it realistic to expect a healthy work/life balance when running a small business?&amp;quot;, and &amp;ldquo;How can a small team of coders compete in a large city&amp;rsquo;s industry?&amp;quot;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s get started!
Can you start an agency on a part-time basis or do you have to go full-time straight away?</description>

      <description>Fast-forward to the official launch and I’m again in London. Inevitably and predictably I cave to the hype and end up downloading it. That first day was a heady haze of constant Pokéstops, lures, and stumbling across rare creatures without meaning to. My boyfriend and I took an hour to walk what ordinarily takes 15 minutes, rapidly becoming those people who suddenly stop dead in the street. On returning home after the weekend I’d levelled substantially, and had already filled my in-game item bag with more Pokéballs than I thought I could ever use.</description>

      <description>For GCSE we learnt how to use word processors, perform mail merges, and to do basic calculations in Excel – to be business users rather than creators. At home I was teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and trying to convince myself I was great at using Paint Shop Pro. To be fair, I do remember that we also spent a couple of lessons drawing shapes with Logo, and we did create some macros using Visual Basic, but programming was never given any context within the curriculum.</description>

      <description>This digitisation of a much-berated industry has gathered immense speed over the last couple of years, coming with the major benefit of claiming to potentially save you thousands over traditional agency fees. Big players include Tepilo (launched in 2009 by Sarah Beeny and agency Codegent), eMoov, Purple Bricks, and our agent, HouseSimple.
Choosing to go online Apologies to the lovely estate agents out there, but after experiences ranging from cringeworthy to teeth-gritting with traditional agents as we started to view properties, my boyfriend and I sat down and did the old classic exercises – identifying your audience, and considering our own needs.</description>

      <description>My original post on the subject explained the background of the project and how it was built. At its core, the tracker consisted of a database and a set of basic services which hooked up the public dashboard, a private PhoneGap wrapped HTML app for Android, and a private Chrome extension. At that point I had ideas for expanding the tracker, or to build in extra features. In early 2015 I attended Seb’s ST4I courseand contemplated hooking up a thermal printer to plot a visual record, or making a reminder system, but all of these fell flat.</description>

      <description>It’s been a bad year. A really bad year. I’ve read quite a few people’s year round-ups and it sounds like it has been for quite a lot of people actually. To put my everything in context, these were my main challenges:
In November 2014 a large piece of building work started mere metres from my home in what was previously a beautiful, quiet paddock. To date it’s not yet finished and there is still heavy machinery floating around.</description>

I have a small amount of (mainly skiing and food-related) German ability, but ecommerce and technical terms were another matter. I needed it translating.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of the things that I love most about my job is that it’s very broad, and that it constantly challenges my perspectives on things that I take for granted. Last year I worked on a project that was very different for me, and it ended up influencing this talk/article.
I want to talk to you about data; specifically the idea of open data. Everyone has gone nuts for data over the last 10 or so years, with buzzword terms like “big data” seeping their way into many a marketer’s vocabulary, and IBMrecently publishing a stat that 90% of the world’s total data has been created just within the past two years.</description>

      <description>“Hi. Thanks for your talk, but just so you know, in future you shouldn’t…”
 This wasn’t the first time that someone had decided to give me their thoughts on one of my talks, but it was the first time that someone had immediately made a beeline to me purely to do so, straight after I had come off stage.
“Don’t read the comments” is a staple of what we’re taught about internet interaction, but this isn’t the case when people are wanting to provide feedback to you in person, and when this is sometimes useful for you to learn from.</description>

      <description>“Evolution”. A simple term; one often thought of in context with the past and our beginnings, and yet one which equally applies to our future. Evolution can be seen throughout our daily lives – sometimes through organic processes that seem to happen almost automatically, beyond our perception, and sometimes it is more deliberate and controlled.
The web has been evolving since its inception in both of these ways. Every day our social feeds and bookmarked lists fill up with yet more articles written, blogs posted, talks recorded – all about the incredible new things that are happening with the web, and what these mean for us.</description>

In my brain, Web in the Woods, despite the clue being in the name, was going to be a collection of people gathering in a field or similar, perhaps with a marquee. There would probably be power cables and charging areas dotted around. I hadn’t expected something that looked like this:</description>

      <description>I spend a lot of time around screens, with my hands often either on a keyboard, a touch-screen, or a game pad. My digital hobbies are long-standing, and have even started to consume some more traditional habits – I’m more likely to be found reading a comic on my tablet nowadays, as I find it easier to keep up with the ever-growing list of titles that I follow. With this in mind, I’ve recently been looking for opportunities to spend more time away from the digital world, and to balance it by doing more things in my spare time that have links to the physical.</description>

I’m now self-employed – starting out as a sole trader and switching to a limited company just over a year in, and the process was much different. I happen to be going through the house purchase process again at the same time as some of my close friends, and whilst everyone’s situation is very different, I wanted to share our stories and my experience of being self-employed with regards to getting a mortgage.</description>

      <description>What is Good For Nothing? First things first, what on earth is Good For Nothing? Simply put, it is:
You can read much more about the concept on the website, as well as finding out whether you’ve got a chapter near you.
For me, it’s about getting to connect with local people and help out organisations in ways that may not always be possible when you go through official channels. It’s also about coming together with people of hugely varying skills, learning from them, and having a great time whilst you’re at it.</description>

Just now I happened to see a new post by Jeremy Keith – someone whose views I find myself nodding along to more often than not – who links to some of the best recent articles on this subject and provides his own thoughts. Jeremy’s site doesn’t accept direct comments, and I headed to twitter to tap out a carefully considered, character-restricted response, but instead I decided to contribute to the noise and to throw a quick blog post out there in the name of owning my own content.</description>

Whilst I was very comfortable presenting to clients and internally at my agency, my first ever public outings were under my role as an Adobe Community Professional at Adobe user groups in Paris and Brussels (which was a pretty terrifying baptism of fire!) and involved paid-for travel and accommodation – something that many user groups aren’t able to afford.</description>

Having had the pleasure of speaking at The Web Is with Seb last year, his talk clearly showcased some of the amazing things that can be done once you start combining the physical and digital worlds. I had heard on the grapevine that he was planning a workshop on the topic, and after speaking to Seb about it one evening and watching the promo video I was incredibly keen to attend.</description>

 “When I was fifteen years old, I missed a period. My boyfriend and I were using a diaphragm, but I knew it was fallible. I was good at math, I had the failure rate memorized, burnt into my subconscious. Or maybe it was my conscious, I can never keep them straight. Anyway, I was terrified.</description>

Last night not only marked the final match of the tournament, but also meant the conclusion of my run of ‘World Cup Dinners’.
I have a love/hate relationship with football. Love, because it’s great. From playing barefoot in the garden, putting cross after cross in to my brother (or a tree if he wasn’t available), to playing at a fairly decent level during school, to now sporadic kick arounds in parks, I’ve always loved playing.</description>

What’s this Watch Dogs thing then? Watch Dogs is “an open world action-adventure stealth video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft” – thanks Wikipedia.</description>

      <description>After a thoroughly brilliant long weekend of conference fun, I was finally back on a train this morning, racing via inevitable delays and route alterations back to the land of Essex. It seemed like as good a time as any to take up Jeremy Keith’s closing call to arms, and to share my experiences of the wonderful Responsive Day Out 2, so here is the story of my time in Brighton.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently done something that I’ve been considering for a while, which is to write and publish an ebook. The result of this was Atomic Documentation, and I released it last week. As with a lot of things that I do, part of it was to overcome a fear. I frequently find myself being guilty of wanting to write something or make something, but then bail on actually putting it out there.</description>

      <description>As part of my fast-approaching presentation at Responsive Day Out 2 I’m (spoilers!) going to be talking very briefly about the upcoming light-level (formerly luminosity) media query, amongst other much more important things like Batman.
The talk is only 15-20 minutes long so there’s only so much detail that I can go into with everything, and I wanted to put a bit more information and context in this post.
Please note that since I started writing my talk this had all changed (as is the fun of draft specs).</description>

      <description>I’ve been working from home a lot recently, and the primary reason (outside of my extreme train grumpiness) is that since the start of the year I’ve been trying to coordinate being here so that I can bring home some kittens. The hope is that by being here daily I can settle them in, and attempt to stop them from causing absolute carnage amongst the assortment of brightly coloured, kitten mouth-sized toys that adorn the shelves and surfaces throughout my house.</description>

      <description>Whilst skimming through my Twitter feed a while ago, I dropped out of the stream quickly to read a post that had been tweeted by Kotaku, the well-known gaming blog. The post caught my eye because it was about Mass Effect, one of my all-time favourite gaming series, but it ended up prompting a deeper thought.
The blog post covered the story of some free DLC that had been released a couple of years ago for the final game in the series.</description>

      <description>Yes folks, it’s that time again. Every now and again I get the urge to make something (usually pretty pointless), and the latest in this series of wonderful distractions is Tea Tracker.
This was actually born way back, in November last year. At the time I was hopping around on trains a lot, and it started as yet another way of keeping my brain from melting by doing something semi-productive. For quite some time I’d been meaning to create a project to keep track of my tea drinking, because it’s the kind of amazingly nerdy thing that fascinates me.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I promised myself that I’d at least try to work with certain people that I was really interested in and was passionate about, either because of the subject matter or the nature of the work that they were doing. As a one-(wo)man-band it’s often quite hard to get a foot in the door with people who just don’t want to speak to anyone but full service agencies, or don’t publish lines of communication, but I’m a firm believer in things not happening unless you try.</description>

      <description>At the start of this year I was over in New York. It was a long weekend away, and despite it being an East Coast timezone rather than the West of my recent trips stateside, I was pretty horribly jetlagged. Waking up ridiculously early usually meant an hour lounging around in bed, finding local diner locations to hit up for breakfast, checking some emails and catching up on everything that had happened in the rest of the world whilst my time- travelling body had slept.</description>

      <description>I’ve been considering forming a limited company to operate under for quite a while now, and this weekend I finally went and did it. I thought I’d put together a quick post for anyone in a similar boat.
Why go limited? As I’ve documented previously, I started out as a sole trader under the slight self-misbelief that I’d “freelance for a while until I found the right proper job”. Being a sole trader seemed to make sense in that mindset, although my accountant did mention right from the start that I may want to consider forming a company if things really took off.</description>

      <description>A friend and ex-colleague of mine, Paul Swain, recently wrote a quick little post called “You’re pissing in my pond now“, which was around his thoughts on the matter of the IT departments and legacy systems that frequently hamper him during his work as Head of User Experience at The Unitin Brighton.
Paul and I have had many discussions over the years on this matter, and worked together on a particularly challenging project where the IT systems and teams were at the core of all decisions being made.</description>

      <description>Anyone who has hit a brick wall with their vocabulary and resorted to summoning a thesaurus, has probably experienced that picking an apparently synonymous word can actually result in a totally different message.
For example, according to thesaurus.com, if searching for a new way to declare my love for someone, I could end up with the following:
“I love you”
“I lust you”
“I fondness you”
“I respect you”
or even, if I’m in a particularly Gallagher-esque mood:</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I was very excited to find out that Marvel had released an API, exposing some of their data. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to have a play with it then as I was headed out to dinner (apparently dropping your other half to play with code isn’t acceptable), and a couple of busy weeks meant that I had to put it to one side for a bit.</description>

      <description>Quite possibly my favourite thing about freelancing is the ability to control my own ability to take time off. In the last couple of years of being an employee I did some notable 6-8 month stints without a day off, and unsurprisingly it was really not very good for me. Spending time in other parts of the world is something that I really love, and one of my aims has been to make the most of being in charge of my own schedule.</description>

      <description>Coming to the end of my full-time job at the end of 2012 was a sad but exciting time. It was the end of an era for me, and I was very sorry not to be working with some great people any more, but was also excited about what lay ahead.
Working on a contract basis I now often have the same feeling, but in more regular bursts. As much as I may have enjoyed a particular project of working with a certain company, moving on always marks the start of something exciting for me, and is something that I really enjoy.</description>

      <description>When starting out with your own business, getting the accounting side of things right can be a big headache. I initially started out using some very basic spreadsheets and pretty InDesign invoices, but as I’ve documented in previous posts I eventually migrated to FreeAgent, which has been absolutely brilliant for me.
Custom invoice templates FreeAgent, amongst being all-round useful, allows you to customise your invoices with very basic CSS skills. They offer several pre-built templates, but I wanted to be sending something which designed up nicely, and matched my brand a bit better than the defaults.</description>

      <description>Many years ago, one of my (now) friends had just started working at the same company as me. Unfortunately I didn’t make the best first impression.
His boss had asked him to “speak to Sally about that” regarding a particular matter now lost in time, so not knowing any different he had emailed me very nicely about whatever it was, to which I sent back a short and strong email saying something along the lines of “THIS IS NOT WITHIN MY REMIT”.</description>

      <description>I’ve recently started thinking about a new talk I’m going to be doing later this year, and since it’s quite a short one I’ve got lots of ideas but need to settle on the strongest themes. When it comes to putting together a structure I tend to be quite visual, and usually end up covering the walls of my home office with a sea of post-its, as well as sketching out assorted diagrams in notebooks.</description>

To which I replied “Splendid as in music, or as in artwork/vinyl itself as a beautiful entity?”. On receiving a response of “Ooh both”, I took this to mean that I should definitely sit in my kitchen at 11pm and start writing stories about selected pieces of my collection. Thanks for prompting me to write about things that I’ve wanted to capture in words for a while, Oli – this post is dedicated to YOU.</description>

      <description>Back in March this year I attended the Responsive Day Out, a conference curated by Clearleft in Brighton. One of the themes throughout the day, and a message which was summed up by Jeremy Keith in the closing moments, was that we need to share more. Sharing shouldn’t just be about our successes and the things we do right, but we should also ensure that we share our difficulties too, so that others can learn from them.</description>

      <description>Last Friday and Saturday I had the pleasure of getting involved with the Colchester branch of Good For Nothing, a scheme which aims to get people coming together and using their skills to help local causes. In their words, “Smart folk collaborating and experimenting to solve stuff that matters”.
We met on the Friday evening to kick off a ’24 hour gig’ – a hackathon over the Friday night and Saturday daytime to help three local causes with everything from websites to social media to posters.</description>

I have just returned from seeing Gravity, a film which appears to be getting rave reviews everywhere. Ok, so in my world ‘everywhere’ spans Empire, conversations, and my twitter feed, but general consensus is that it’s pretty amazing.</description>

      <description>I had the great pleasure of speaking at LWC 2013 in Shoreditch, London yesterday for my last speaking gig of 2013. It was a fantastic day, full of absolutely lovely people and some brilliant talks. In a happy coincidence a lot of the talks had similar themes and messages, and I was very grateful to be amongst such great speakers. Big thanks to Mint Digital and all of the organisers for putting together something that ran so well, to the other speakers for being so interesting, and for everyone who attended for being so receptive and great to talk to.</description>

      <description>I’m incredibly pleased that something I wrote has been chosen to be featured on The Pastry Box Projectas today’s post. When I heard that the site was being opened up to general submissions, I came home, sat on the sofa, and promptly emptied my head of some thoughts that had been swimming around inside it for a few days. As with all good musings it had started out as a pub chat, this one occurring with a friend during an incredibly bland England match, and I had originally intended to capture the sentiment in a blog post at some point.</description>

      <description>After speaking at Adobe MAX in May and Scotch on the Rocks in June earlier this year I needed a bit of a pause on the speaking front. I’d started a new contract, work was becoming incredibly busy, and I’d started getting lots of speaking doubts around the time of Scotch which had made for some sleepless nights. I was actually contacted about a brilliant opportunity shortly after, which part of me is still kicking myself for not going after, but I felt I needed to focus on the day job and come back to speaking later once I had some better formed ideas.</description>

      <description>This time last year I had my dConstruct ticket in my virtual mitts, the hotel was booked, and I was excited about the prospect of a day out at the seaside with several of my smartest colleagues and friends. On the Thursday before the event I was on a train back from a meeting in London, and received a phone call. A new project had come in, and I was needed to fly out to San Francisco that Saturday.</description>

      <description>Today I have been left to fend for myself whilst my other half is out doing virtuous deeds for others, and having spent the last week off in rural Norfolk doing everything but be on the internet, I wanted to spend some time putting together another quick hack to engage my brain before returning to work.
I always carry a notebook with me in my bag no matter where I’m going, and I use it to write down all the germs of ideas which could some day make it into something resembling an end-result.</description>

      <description>Chris Coyier blogged an interesting take on job titles in the web industryyesterday, aiming to provide some standardised terms that we can all use to gain a common understanding, and to avoid the ridiculous “ninja” / “rockstar” terminology.
Citing two primary issues of “The opinion on their usefulness range from harmful (i.e. leads to “not my job” syndrome) to vital (i.e. people change companies sometimes and need common language).“, this is something that I can relate to.</description>

Every day I find myself keeping a mental tally of things that happen, with the same issues kept coming up again and again. I lent some rather tongue-in-cheek thoughts to a friend of mine’s blog postrecently on the delicate subject of train etiquette and snoozing, but I felt like there was more I could do with this subject.</description>

I am however glad that I’ve tried to expand my skillset a bit, and to push myself into learning some new principles. The 5 rules above are things that I’ll try to stick to in future, as I found that it really helped to keep me focussed. I’m still working on the final bits for the site at the moment, and if I get permission I’ll post a write up once it has launched.</description>

      <description>Having been an Instagram user for a good while now (433 photos and counting), I have taken my fair share of banter over my usage of the service, primarily from my long-suffering boyfriend who frequently turns around to find I’ve scampered off out of sight after something has caught my eye.
An article in my twitter feed, with the title bait of ‘How Instagram almost ruined my life‘ tempted me into reading it recently.</description>

      <description>This is incredibly belated as it’s now almost a month ago, but I wanted to share my experiences of speaking at the Scotch on the Rocksconference 2013, organised by Fuzzy Orangeand held in Edinburgh.
Speaking Speaking at Scotch was something that I’d wanted to do for a while. Back in 2011 I’d done a couple of user group talks, and remember having a few chats at the 2011 conference itself around whether I was the kind of person they’d ever give a slot to.</description>

      <description>I like to think that I’m generally a pretty laid back person, however as those who know me well will testify, every now and again something will come along that turns me temporarily into a ranty, wildly gesturing little ball of vitriol. For at least a couple of minutes anyway, until something else shiny catches my eye on the internet, or I become more interested in having a nap.
One such thing happened earlier today, when a friend of mine tweeted “FAO: Nerds.</description>

      <description>This week I had the huge honour of speaking at Adobe MAX, Adobe’s annual conference for digital professionals, which was held this year in Los Angeles.
As someone based in the UK, MAX isn’t always achievable, and even less so now I’m a humble freelancer. October 2011 was my previous MAX (and also my first), and I was absolutely thrilled to be able to attend this time.
I’ve collected together some lengthy thoughts here – on my week’s highlights, on my session, and most importantly on the announcements themselves.</description>

Let’s not dwell on our differences. The simple fact is that we are all tablet brothers, bonded by a singular truth. And that truth is that most of the time it doesn’t matter whether you’re looking at an Android device or an iOS device (or a Microsoft Surfa… oh, who am I trying to kid?</description>

      <description>BattleBlock Theatre, the latest output by The Behemoth, is equal parts brilliant, cutesy platformer fun vs mind boggling frustration.
Anyone who has been in close proximity to me whilst playing anything will tell you that I am a sweary gamer. I frequently talk out loud. I call collections of pixels all manner of obscenities, and my virtual demise is usually met with some very creative combinations of words. Considering that my deaths count on BBT currently stands at 1549 (and rapidly rising) you can imagine the sort of language that has been pouring out of my living room recently.</description>

Once there I’m very excited that I’m going to be attending Adobe MAX, but not only that, I will also be speaking.
Me, me, me! My session is on “Effective technical strategy and planning for websites and mobile apps“, and I’ll be going through a process for getting to grips with a project before your fingertips start churning out code.</description>

      <description>Every once in a while something comes along where you kick yourself for not thinking of it first. On a recent ski holiday to Austria I encountered one of these equally frustrating and brilliant instances.
The resort I was in, the ‘Skicircus’ of Saalbach, Hinterglemm and Leoganghas recently introduced the Skilinesystem, essentially comprised of services which expose lift pass data to app and website interfaces. At the time of writing there is a ‘full’ site, a mobile site, and apps for Androidand iOS.</description>

I’m obviously a pretty recent ‘switcher’, so I by no means consider myself an expert on the wonderful and crazy world that is self-employment. I have however learnt an awful lot in the last few months, so if my anecdotes can be of help to anyone considering a similar leap then great.</description>

      <description>Having got a Raspberry Pifor Christmas, up until today it had been sat in its original bag when it wasn’t being used. As such I decided to follow in the tradition of DIY cases and make an initial temporary case for the Pi out of Lego to give it a proper home and to hopefully reduce the likelihood of me mishandling it/getting tea on it/breaking it.
Using the remains of a 1999 Sith Infiltrator, and what could only have been a Creator Prehistoric Powerset along with other bricks in my spares box, I was able to come up with the above.</description>

For those of you who don’t know what SmartGlass is, it “turns your mobile phone or tablet into a second screen that intelligently interacts with your Xbox 360 to elevate your entertainment experience” – http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/smartglass.
I wanted to do something simple – sign in and check my messages – so I loaded up the app and after a rather nice, clean loading animation I was presented with the sign in screen.</description>

      <description>As I’m sure we’re all aware, there’s yet another End of the World prediction for the 21st December. Dear readers, I would like to put your minds at ease, and say that whilst the date of the prediction is indeed accurate, as with all of these things the meaning has been misinterpreted over time. I’d like to take this opportunity to clear everything up – the Mayans were right and the 21st will indeed mark the end of a great age, but it will mark the last time I am in the office as an employee of Lightmaker (*small print official last day 24th, working from home) rather than fiery deaths for us all.</description>

My session was ‘An introduction to the modern web for the creative professional’, a 45 minute talk which aimed to cover an overview of HTML5 and associated technologies, including some examples around its use within the industry.
Despite the venue having some technical issues I had a great time on the day and really enjoyed giving the presentation and being part of the event.</description>

Highlights of this for me was the work they are doing to progress CSS3 in the form of their CSS FilterLab, along with the evolution of tools I’m already using and love, such as Shadow, which has now joined the suite of ‘Edge’ tools and services.</description>

      <description>It’s with great pleasure that I’m able to announce that I have had my Adobe Community Professional status renewed for another term and will be an ACP for 2012-2013.
Since joining the program in January 2011 a lot has changed for me. I’ve moved from a more development-focussed role at work into one which is more sprategic, and I spend a lot of time doing internal planning as well as technical consultancy.</description>

Like many, I’m a sucker for a good API so it was a pleasure to be asked to lend my views and a tiny version of my face to the article. As usual I’m always on the lookout for more writing opportunities, so if you’d like to discuss anything please get in touch.</description>

      <description>Several years ago, when headed to London alone one evening, I took with me a couple of headshots and scribbled notes about people that I was hoping to bump into that night. I wasn’t out on some kind of hitman mission (well, I would say that…), but instead was heading to an industry event which some interesting people I’d previously spoken to on twitter were happening to attend.
Doing this took me back to my past, when I’d lived a mis-spent youth making friends with people that I knew off the internet.</description>

      <description>Having caught the writing bug recently I’m very pleased that I’ve had another article published, this time by CreativeBloQ, part of Future UK.
Not writing about technology for once, this piece is instead about one of my other interests – the world of designer toys. Before I started working from home my Lightmaker desk was absolutely covered with vinyl figures, but due to the practicalities of a few too many desk moves and less time spent actually at my work desk over the last year these have now all been migrated to my home office.</description>

      <description>Seeing as it’s been officially released into the wild now, I’m pleased to say that I’ve written an article for Fourth Source, an independent online digital media marketing publication. The article is “Developing an effective mobile strategy“.
Working with clients to identify the options available to them, and discussing why certain approaches may be more feasible than others should be an important part of all new projects. I’m lucky enough to work with a great Strategy team who keep me on my toes, and I look forward to being challenged by new developments in the future.</description>

      <description>At Lightmaker, our strategic work often revolves around gathering the opinions of others and feeding these into our plans for projects. Whether stakeholders or users, asking the right questions and opening topics up to discussion can often help uncover views that would otherwise have been missed.
When working on internal business strategy I think it’s important to bear the same principles in mind, and as such I recently carried out a survey of all UK studio staff in order to get their opinions on technical change.</description>

Those of you visiting on a mobile or tablet device will likely notice the most difference, as I’ve gone responsive. Responsive designis something that I really believe in, and it was important to me to start making some changes to reflect that.</description>

      <description>Developers hate inefficiencies. We hate repetitive tasks. We hate having to re-type something we’ve not 30 seconds ago typed in on a different device, especially considering we’re likely surrounded by about 10 of the damn things. This is why I love Adobe Shadow.
Adobe Shadow is a new inspection and preview tool which aims to remove some of the common pains of the present day development workflow. Mobile is a given for new projects nowadays, and since it’s preferable to view output on real devices rather than emulators it’s easy to end up in a situation where time and patience is wasted on frequently refreshing a sea of devices littering your desk.</description>

      <description>It was announced last week that the UK government will be replacing the current Information and Communications Technology curriculum with that of a Computer Science focused course.
In a move that has been strongly welcomed by the development community, it will mean a dramatic about turn from this time last year when the government were thenconsidering making ICT a non-compulsory part of the curriculum.
As someone who studied ICT throughout my school life, taking qualifications at GCSE level (age 14-16), then IT at AS and A-Level (age 16-18) I think that this is a great move.</description>

      <description>2011 was a tough year, but a very good year. Whenever New Year rolls around I inevitably tend to start thinking about where I was and what I was doing at the same point a year ago. Usually I can’t believe how much things have changed, and this year is no exception.
This year has been incredibly busy, both personally and professionally, and has been unlike anything previous. There have been some amazing highlights, but it has all come after an awful lot of hard work, and I’ve learnt a lot of tough lessons about what not to do.</description>

      <description>Earlier this year I made the tough decision to commit to moving out of Kent, and up to East Anglia. This obviously tied into decisions about my working life, which up until that point had revolved around heading in to the office in Tunbridge Wells every day for the last 6 years. After some very honest chats with the directors at Lightmaker, it was decided that both parties would give me working remotely a chance.</description>

I’m pleased to say that this has been turned into a Success Story for the adobe.com site, and is now live.

      <description>Adobe MAX is Adobe’s annual conference, which for 2011 was held in Los Angeles, USA. Every year 5000 conference attendees gather to share Adobe’s latest big reveals, attend sessions by industry leaders, and join in with community and ‘unconference’ events.
This was my first MAX, and was something which I have been looking forward to for a long time. Having never been to a conference outside of the UK I was unsure what to expect from a lot of things.</description>

      <description>A while ago Steve Bryant came up with the excellent idea of August 1st being designated How I Got Started In ColdFusion Day, for which ColdFusion users tell their origin story. As a big fan of encouraging others to take up coding, I thought I’d bring my story to the table. Let’s start right back at the beginning…
We had computers in the house since I was young, and I’ve never felt any kind of fear or hesitation about jumping in and messing around using trial and error.</description>

      <description>Like most people, hearing about Google+ last week caused me to immediately sign up to be invited to the Beta. Shortly after I was lucky enough to be sent an invite using a well known loophole, and took it upon myself to start shooting out invites to friends, colleagues and family members in an attempt to start filling my circles with fellow users.
After using G+ (yeah, I’m on that naming convention bandwagon) for a week, I thought I’d write up some thoughts on the service now I’ve had some time for it to settle down.</description>

      <description>Today brought the announcement of Adobe’s first mid-cycle release for Creative Suite 5.5. Instead of continuing with uninterrupted milestone releases, these will be moved to a two-year cycle, with mid-cycle releases keeping the product relevant and at the cutting edge of technology.
There were two main sides to the announcement – functionality and licensing.
Licensing So is this just a ploy by Adobe to take our money more regularly? Quite the opposite – one of Adobe’s big changes has been the introduction of a Subscription Edition in order to make upgrading more affordable and more suited to users’ fluctuating usage scenarios.</description>

      <description>As Solutions Architect some of the core elements of my job are to keep up-to-date with new developments within the industry, to advise my organisation and clients about technical strategy, and make recommendations, whether that be on a project basis or as part of more general business strategy. Because of this, I was very interested when I learned that Terrence Ryan had written a book on Driving Technical Change.
The book’s subtitle is “Why People On Your Team Don’t Act on Good Ideas, and How to Convince Them They Should”, and is likely to strike a chord with many – on reading this simple statement alone several encounters came to mind, and I’m sure that others have experienced a similar reaction.</description>

      <description>After three non-stop days of travel, keynotes, sessions, and networking, Scotch on the Rocks is now over for another year. The quality of the speakers this year was first class, and that coupled with an excellent venue and a brilliant community made for what I consider to be the best Scotch yet.
The conference was held at the Apex International Hotel in Edinburgh, and with the majority of attendees staying either in the International or its neighbouring sister hotel the Apex City it ensured that there was always a large contingent of people to chat to at any time of the day or night.</description>

For my own future reference, as well as for anyone travelling to conferences or other business-related gatherings, here’s my preparation checklist.</description>
