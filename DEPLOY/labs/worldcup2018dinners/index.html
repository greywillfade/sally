					<p>Every two years, for the duration of the World Cup or European Championship football tournaments, Robert and Sally Lait cook a meal every day from the cuisine of one of the teams playing. This site documents our adventures in 2018. </p>

							<p>Each day of the tournament, pick a team that's playing.<br />
								Cook something from, or inspired by their national cuisine.<br />
								Do not repeat meals.</p>
							<p>The aim is not to cook in support of a team, or to pick the winning team (although we like to keep track of how it ties in). It's to cook as wide a range of new dishes as possible, to learn new things about each country, and try new food. Aim to avoid repetition of teams as much as you can (strategic choices during group stages are advised).</p>
							<p>For a better idea of how this works, have a look at one of the previous two tournament sites since we started taking this pretty seriously:</p>

								<p>We're baaaaaack! First day excitement! We thought that it was only appropriate to go with the home team for this one, which is something we've done for the last two tournaments. After researching options at the weekend I decided to go for two courses: <b>blinis and caviar</b>, followed by <b>beef stroganoff</b>.</p>
								<p>For the blinis, there were tons of recipes out there but I ended up following a pretty typical pancake recipe. As I only wanted a couple I used 1/2 cup of self-raising flour (actually wholemeal as I had some I needed to use up), an egg, 1/2 cup of milk, and a pinch of salt. I cooked each individually in a mini frying pan in a small amount of oil before resting them on kitchen roll. I added crème fraîche  to some lemon zest and dill, which was put on top along with smoked salmon and more lemon zest/dill leaves, plus caviar. Unfortunately I was limited by my local supermarket on this front (red ikura caviar is my absolute favourite), so this was just the cheap black stuff.</p>
								<p>I don't think I've ever had stroganoff before, mainly because it always, always comes with mushrooms, which are my single most hated food. When I was first looking it was originally a write-off for this reason... however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Stroganoff">Wikipedia</a> to the rescue! According to this, the first-known recipe (1871) does <b>not</b> include mushrooms (or onions, but I have no issue with them, so they stay). I therefore decided to honour this, following those well-known Russians the <a href="http://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/beef-stroganoff">Hairy Bikers' recipe</a> but leaving out the mushrooms. This was accompanied by chips, which according to Wikipedia again is an acceptable accompaniment. These were sliced thinly and put in the oven with hot rapeseed oil, seasoning, and three garlic cloves until crisp.</p>
