					<p>Every two years, for the duration of the World Cup or European Championship football tournaments, Robert and Sally Lait cook a meal every day from the cuisine of one of the teams playing. This site documents our adventures in 2018. </p>

							<p>Each day of the tournament, pick a team that's playing.<br />
								Cook something from, or inspired by their national cuisine.<br />
								Do not repeat meals.</p>
							<p>The aim is not to cook in support of a team, or to pick the winning team (although we like to keep track of how it ties in). It's to cook as wide a range of new dishes as possible, to learn new things about each country, and try new food. Aim to avoid repetition of teams as much as you can (strategic choices during group stages are advised).</p>
							<p>For a better idea of how this works, have a look at one of the previous two tournament sites since we started taking this pretty seriously:</p>

									<h3>Saturday 16th June 2018</h3>

									<h6>Fairy bread</h6>

									<p>Every time we play this, you have some days where previously arranged social engagements mean that you're going to have some struggles actually cooking. Today is one of those days. As an aside, I'm trying not to think about the fact that I'm going to be in Japan for the closing stages... let's just say they'd better do well!</p>
									<p>With a 7 hour drive ahead and a weekend away for a friend's wedding, we weren't going to be able to do dinner or lunch and needed to get a bit creative. Australia to the rescue! This nutritious and nourishing snack is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy_bread">Fairy Bread</a>, which Wikipedia informs me dates back to the 1920s. It's served at kids parties by people who don't value their sanity, and I figured that it'd be good road trip sustenance. I managed three slices. The butter is just too much.</p>
									<p>Whilst researching this I did enjoy the raft of opinionated articles out there in the fairy bread community. Here are a few for your reading pleasure:</p>

									<h3>Friday 15th June 2018</h3>

									<h6>Koshari</h6>

									<p>First day excitement led to second day <em>"oh god I need to finish this proposal and get it sent"</em> so Robert took the reins for this one. I shouldn't have expected anything else having seen the recipe, but this is a CARBTASTIC dish. It's basically a layer of pasta, with a layer of rice, with a layer of lentils, covered in two sauces. I'd also bought chickpeas, which some recipes include, but Robert didn't know that and left them out.</p>
									<p>The limey tomato sauce was the highlight of this dish and I'd definitely use that again in something else, but not sure that the rest of this one will be coming into regular rotation.</p>

									<h3>Thursday 14th June 2018</h3>
									<h4>ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º <b>Russia</b> v ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ Saudi Arabia</h4>
									<h5>5-0</h5>
									<h6>Blinis and caviar, beef stroganoff</h6>

									</div>

									<p>We're baaaaaack! First day excitement! We thought that it was only appropriate to go with the home team for this one, which is something we've done for the last two tournaments. After researching options at the weekend I decided to go for two courses: <b>blinis and caviar</b>, followed by <b>beef stroganoff</b>.</p>
									<p>For the blinis, there were tons of recipes out there but I ended up following a pretty typical pancake recipe. As I only wanted a couple I used 1/2 cup of self-raising flour (actually wholemeal as I had some I needed to use up), an egg, 1/2 cup of milk, and a pinch of salt. I cooked each individually in a mini frying pan in a small amount of oil before resting them on kitchen roll. I added crÃ¨me fraÃ®che  to some lemon zest and dill, which was put on top along with smoked salmon and more lemon zest/dill leaves, plus caviar. Unfortunately I was limited by my local supermarket on this front (red ikura caviar is my absolute favourite), so this was just the cheap black stuff.</p>
									<p>I don't think I've ever had stroganoff before, mainly because it always, always comes with mushrooms, which are my single most hated food. When I was first looking it was originally a write-off for this reason... however, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beef_Stroganoff">Wikipedia</a> to the rescue! According to this, the first-known recipe (1871) does <b>not</b> include mushrooms (or onions, but I have no issue with them, so they stay). I therefore decided to honour this, following those well-known Russians the <a href="http://www.hairybikers.com/recipes/view/beef-stroganoff">Hairy Bikers' recipe</a> but leaving out the mushrooms. This was accompanied by chips, which according to Wikipedia again is an acceptable accompaniment. These were sliced thinly and put in the oven with hot rapeseed oil, seasoning, and three garlic cloves until crisp.</p>
									<p>This was really enjoyable, and I'd definitely cook it again as a quick evening meal.</p>
