## Legally Binding, Probably

WHEREAS cookies are a matter of great consequence;<br />
AND WHEREAS biscuits masquerading as cookies shall not be tolerated;<br />
IT IS HEREBY DECREED as follows:

**1. Article I: Dimensional Requirements**<br />
Cookies shall measure no less than six (6) inches in diameter. Any item failing to meet this threshold shall be reclassified as a “biscuit” and summarily dismissed.

**2. Article II: State of Dough**<br />
All cookies must be maintained in a doughy, borderline under-done condition. Over-baking constitutes a breach of contract.

**3. Article III: Matcha Clause**<br />
The inclusion of matcha shall be considered evidence of supreme cookie quality. Absence of matcha is permissible but discouraged.

**4. Article IV: Chocolate Chip Precedent**<br />
White chocolate chips are to be held superior to milk or dark chocolate chips in all circumstances. 

**5. Article V: Fruit Admissibility**<br />
Citrus flavourings (including but not limited to lemon and lime) may appear only by special petition. Conversely, cherries and berries shall be welcomed with enthusiasm.

**6. Article VI: Oatmeal & Raisin Ruling**<br />
Notwithstanding public controversy, the oatmeal-raisin combination is affirmed to be a wholly acceptable cookie form.

Failure to comply with this Cookie Policy may result in (a) confiscation of one’s current and future cookie supplies, (b) replacement with stale digestives, or (c) both.

Witnesseth: this policy is binding until the last cookie has been consumed.


## The best cookie recipe
Now that the formalities are out of the way, the best recipe I've found to date, and one which has come out perfectly every time, is the following. All credit to my namesake Sally (not my baking alter ego) who's responsible for for the recipe. For full details please see her [Chewy Chocolate Chunk Cookies recipe](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/05/13/chewy-chocolate-chunk-cookies/). I can highly recommend trying coconut, cherry, and fudge. I've copied the recipe in below in case the original ever disappears.

### Ingredients
* 2 and 1/4 cups (280 grams) plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170 grams) unsalted butter, melted
* 3/4 cup (135 grams) light brown sugar, loosely packed
* 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup (180 grams) chocolate chips/anything else you like


### Directions

Sieve the flour, baking soda, cornflour and salt into a large bowl and set it aside.

Melt the butter, put it into a big bowl, and mix it with the brown sugar and white sugar until no lumps remain. Mix in the egg and the egg yolk. Finally, add in the vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together. The dough should be very soft but thick. Fold in the chocolate chips or whatever else you are using. Try to get them evenly dispersed, although depending on what you're using they may not stick to the dough very well.

Cover the dough and chill in the fridge for 2 hours, or up to 3 days. Chilling sucks, I know, but this bit is important. Science.

Take the dough out of the fridge and allow to slightly soften at room temperature for about 10 minutes, or as long as your patience can last.

Preheat the oven to 160&deg;c degrees (non-fan oven, about 140&deg;c for fan). Line some baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Roll the dough into balls – around the size a of golf ball should do, but you may want to experiment depending on your own personal cookie policy. Put them on the baking tray, ensuring to keep a good amount of space around each one as they will expand. Lightly flatten them, but keep them taller rather than wide so that they stay gooey.

Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. This bit is important: **the cookies will look very soft and underbaked**. Take them out anyway. Trust me. They will continue to bake after they're out. Leave them where they are, in the baking tray, for 10 minutes as they start to cool. This will help them to firm up. After this, take them out of the tray and move them to a wire rack to cool completely (or eat them straight away).

You can make the cookie dough in volume and freeze it for up to three months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.
