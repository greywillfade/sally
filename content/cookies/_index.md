## Policy details

Extremely important to state, as I'm sure we're all aware. My official cookie policy is as follows:

* Optimally, cookies should be around 6 inches in diameter.
* It is mandatory for cookies to be doughy, even under-done.
* White chocolate is preferable to milk chocolate in reference to chips.
* Citrus flavours (lemon and lime) are not preferable, though cherry/berries are to be encouraged.
* Although contentious, I can confirm that raisin and oatmeal is a more than acceptable combination.


## The best cookie recipe
The best recipe I have found to date, and one which has come out perfectly every time, is the following. All credit to my namesake Sally (not my baking alter ego) who is responsible for for the recipe. For full details please see her [Chewy Chocolate Chunk Cookies recipe](http://sallysbakingaddiction.com/2013/05/13/chewy-chocolate-chunk-cookies/). I can highly recommend trying coconut, cherry, and fudge. The recipe is noted below in case the original ever disappears.

### Ingredients
* 2 and 1/4 cups (280 grams) plain flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1 and 1/2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 3/4 cup (1.5 sticks or 170 grams) unsalted butter, melted
* 3/4 cup (135 grams) light brown sugar, loosely packed
* 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
* 1 large egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1 cup (180 grams) chocolate chips/anything else you like


### Directions

Sieve the flour, baking soda, cornflour and salt into a large bowl and set it aside.

Melt the butter, put it into a big bowl, and whisk it with the brown sugar and white sugar until no lumps remain. Whisk in the egg and the egg yolk. Finally, whisk in the vanilla. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix together. The dough should be very soft but thick. Fold in the chocolate chips or whatever else you are using. Try to get them evenly dispersed, although depending on what you're using  they may not stick to the dough very well.

Cover the dough and chill in the fridge for 2 hours, or up to 3 days. Chilling sucks, I know, but this bit is important. Science.

Take the dough out of the fridge and allow to slightly soften at room temperature for about 10 minutes, or as long as your patience can last.

Preheat the oven to 160&deg;c degrees (non-fan oven, about 140&deg;c for fan). Line some baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Roll the dough into balls - around the size a of golf ball should do, but you may want to experiment depending on your own personal cookie policy. Put them on the baking tray, ensuring to keep a good amount of space around each one as they will expand. Lightly flatten them, but keep them taller rather than wide so that they stay gooey.

Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes. This bit is important - **the cookies will look very soft and underbaked**. Take them out anyway. Trust me. They will continue to bake after they're out. Leave them where they are, in the baking tray, to cool for 10 minutes to start to cool. This will help them to firm up. After this, move them to a wire rack to cool completely (or eat them straight away).

You can make the cookie dough in volume and freeze it for up to three months. Bake frozen cookie dough balls for an extra minute, no need to thaw.
