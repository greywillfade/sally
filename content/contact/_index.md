### I'd like to talk about work or speaking. How can I reach you?

The best way to get hold of me is either on the form here or my email, which is <b>sally at recordssoundthesame.com</b>. If it's something tiny, <a href="http://twitter.com/sallylait">Twitter</a> is a good alternative.

### Can I call/Hangout/Skype instead? I like talking in person.
Sure! Email me and we can arrange a time and share details then.

### Where are you based? What happens if my [thing] isn't near you?
Thatâ€™s not a problem; I love to travel. I'm based in Suffolk, around 45 minutes from Colchester train station, an hour from Stansted Airport, and I have my own car.
