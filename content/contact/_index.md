### I'd like to talk about work or speaking. How can I reach you?
The best way to get hold of me is either on the form here or my email, which is <b>sally at recordssoundthesame.com</b>. If it's something tiny, <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sally">Mastodon</a> is a good alternative.

### Where are you based? What happens if my [thing] isn't near you?
I'm based in Suffolk in the east of the UK, around 45 minutes from Colchester train station, an hour from Stansted Airport, and I have my own car. I love to travel and am definitely open to hearing from you, but with a young family I do need to think carefully about the practicalities, so may not be able to do everything.
