## My experience
I started speaking in 2011 at user groups in Europe before branching out into conferences a couple of years later. Since then Iâ€˜ve spoken at a wide range of different events globally, including **Adobe MAX** and **EmpireJS** in the US, **DevRelCon** in Japan, **ACE! Conference** and **Front-Trends** in Poland, and **Fronteers** in Amsterdam (amongst many others). As well as giving 'standard' talks I've also keynoted, and hosted events as MC.

My talks have spanned a range of topics, but I mostly aim to mix practical takeaways with inspiration. You can get a feel for the kind of things that I talk about in some of the below videos and links. In addition to conferences, I've also spoken at schools, universities, and private corporate events. Sometimes people even give nice [Twitter feedback](https://twitter.com/sallylait/timelines/578535730181496832) about what I've said.
