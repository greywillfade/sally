Monzo has been going through a collective redundancy consultation process, and as part of that I decided to take voluntary redundancy. My plans are to interview over the next few weeks, so I'd like to hear from anyone that may want to work together now or in the future 👋🏻


## My most recent role
I joined Monzo in 2018 as a Senior Engineering Manager, after which we went through a phase of hyper-growth and set up Collectives (vertical slices of the company). Since then I worked in the role of **Engineering Director**, responsible for **engineering within for the Operations Collective** (spanning all aspects of customer support, and fighting financial crime). I was also **discipline lead for web** across the business. My work included things like:

👥 Sitting on the leadership team for Ops Collective to represent engineering, alongside the COO, VP Ops etc.

👩🏻‍💻 My line of management in Operations included 4 other engineering managers (some also managed managers), and around 40 engineers, split across 6 multidisciplinary squads.

📈 Setting strategy, KRIs, making decisions around technology, or situations that affected our engineers.

👭 Partnering with technical leads, senior engineers, and product managers to help drive technical initiatives, strategic work, and scaling improvements.

🔢 Headcount planning, team structure.

💼 Contributing to management best practices and initiatives.

🕸 Setting strategy for the web at Monzo.

🙌🏽 Leading hiring for the web, including aiming to attract and hire high potential team members from diverse backgrounds.

😬 Risk and compliance responsibilities.

Some of the things that I'm most proud of include proposing and starting up new teams (Web Platform and Web Consultancy), leading the successful delivery of redeveloping Monzo’s engineering progression framework, and helping to scale our engineering function to support the company reaching over 4.2 million customers.



## Performance and feedback

In my last performance review I gained a rating of "exceeding expectations", the highest rating. Here's the kind of feedback that I get:

<blockquote>
<p>
You can look at something, like the web discipline, and figure out what the problems are and how you might solve them. I’ve seen you do this to great effect in the web discipline, turning those plans into action. Every time I read one of your docs it makes me think “yes, Sally has got this”.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>You are a very supportive manager who has built excellent relationships with high trust and safety, I wish I had this superpower. Across the people I manage, you are still getting the best feedback from your reports on trust and safety.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>She is very thoughtful about the strategy of ops & how we can get it to a place where squads have momentum, impact & individuals are happy and motivated at work. She balances this with pragmatism about the changes we can/should make now and the ones we need to be patient about & focus on a
longer lasting change in culture. Example - making people changes within ops and balancing company needs with engineers personal development.</p>

## What I'm interested in

I'm interested in Engineering Director-level roles at organisations which have a mission and values that I believe in.

I enjoy working at places where the people are smart and kind, where I can learn and experience new things, where the culture is inclusive and challenges itself to be better.

Speaking and writing are things I really enjoy, and I'd like to be able to share the things that we work on.

Others are faster and better than me at hands-on professional coding work nowadays, but I'd like to stay close to technology at a senior level, and ideally work with the web in some form.

I'm based in Suffolk in the UK and don't plan to relocate at this point. I'd be most interested in roles where I can work remotely at least some of the time. That said, some degree of travel is fine, especially if it involves places that I care about (bonus points if you have an office in Japan!).

I'm not in any rush, and it's more important for me to find the right fit, at the right time for both of us.

If you think that you may have something that'd be of interest, please [get in touch](/contact)! I look forward to hearing from you 😊
