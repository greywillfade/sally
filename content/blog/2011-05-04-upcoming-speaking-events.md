I&#8217;m very pleased to announce that I will be a speaker on the Adobe ColdFusion User Groups tour at events in Paris on the 30th of May and Brussels on the 31st of May.

The presentation I&#8217;ll be giving will be:

**Building dynamic mobile applications with ColdFusion**

_The world of device development is one where rules and approaches can shift rapidly, but also one where excitement is high and there is huge potential for innovation._

_In this session we&#8217;ll be covering why, as a ColdFusion developer, you may want to build mobile applications, and how ColdFusion is a great platform to power them. Using a real world project as an example we will explore the development process from brief to completion, examining the challenges you may face along the way._

_Sally Jenkinson is Solutions Architect at Lightmaker UK, an Adobe Partner Agency. With 6 years of ColdFusion experience, Sally has worked with clients including Electronic Arts, Innocent Drinks, The David Beckham Academy, Sony Entertainment and Disney, and is an Adobe Community Professional for 2011. Primarily responsible for technical strategy and partnership management, Sally works closely with Lightmaker&#8217;s development team in order to produce award-winning websites and apps. Outside of work Sally can usually be found on Xbox LIVE, in a restaurant, or planning her next holiday._

Slides and supporting information will of course be posted online closer to the event.

I&#8217;m really excited to be a part of these events, and I look forward to hopefully meeting lots of you there!
