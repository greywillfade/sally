Last week was a busy one. Amongst some work with <a href="http://theodi.org/" target="_blank">the ODI</a> that we&#8217;re doing for the BBC, I also spoke at an event called <a href="http://thedigitalpond.com/" target="_blank">The Digital Pond</a> one evening.

The Digital Pond is a free meetup, and this one was titled &#8216;_Responding To The Responsive Web: Insights On Reshaping User Experience_&#8216;. I had the pleasure of catching up with fellow Pond speaker <a href="http://adactio.com/" target="_blank">Jeremy Keith</a>, and was glad that unlike our first meeting back in June, this time around I was less of a nervous wreck about speaking and could actually process enough words to have a better chat. I look forward to continuing my run of events with him (but more importantly absorbing his local food knowledge) in Bologna for <a href="http://2014.fromthefront.it/" target="_blank">From the Front</a> next month.

My talk was an extended version of the one I gave at Jeremy&#8217;s <a href="http://responsiveconf.com/" target="_blank">Responsive Day Out 2</a>, and covered pretty much the same themes but in a different order and amount of depth. It&#8217;s basically about how I think technology is an important part of experiences, and how it can be used to make sites more responsive&#8230; but with a cautioner! It was great to be able to expand on some areas that I&#8217;d had to fly through in the previous version, but I&#8217;m still not entirely happy with it and will be throwing it all back through the mincer before its final outing in September. I hadn&#8217;t had much time to learn the new parts, so I&#8217;d also like to work on being more comfortable with fewer notes too.

After both talks, we fielded an assortment of questions from the audience. I would like to apologise to anyone from the 228 attendees who had to leave as it was getting late, or who were desperately lusting after a beer, because we rambled on. A lot. And I loved it. It&#8217;s always interesting to talk to people about their opinions and the challenges they face, and the Q&A, at least for me, was the best bit of the night. Jeremy&#8217;s talk was brilliant, but hearing him speak off the cuff on subjects that he&#8217;s clearly very passionate and knowledgeable about (and getting to throw in my two pennies&#8217; worth) was even better. More ranting opportunities at future events, meetup/conference organisers!

  What may appear to be a romantic duet in the midst of the crowd was actually the first question &#8211; how do we judge what is &#8216;ethical&#8217;?

My slides are up <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/sallyjenkinson/more-than-media-queries-the-digital-pond" target="_blank">on Slideshare</a>, and I believe that there will be videos released at some point, so watch out for those. I&#8217;ll add them to this post if I&#8217;m made aware of them.

I&#8217;d encourage you all to head to a Digital Pond in the future if you can. Thanks once again to the organisers, and to everyone who came. I had a really fun night.
