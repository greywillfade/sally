<p class="lede">After the first iteration at LeadDev last year, I was thrilled to be invited back as one of the co-facilitators of the "Connecting Leaders with Disabilities" community representation group (CRG) at this year's LDX3 event.</p>

The idea of the CRGs is pretty simple - dedicated space is created as part of the event for different communities to come together. They're intended as relaxed drop-in sessions where attendees can connect with folks in leadership who might have backgrounds and experiences similar to them, and the role of the hosts is to help steer the discussion with attendees. 

Last year was the first time the groups had been run, and I was pleasantly surprised at how many people came to our table... so much so that we had to run around to get more chairs! This year we again filled up capacity, and I managed to meet some really great people and help them share their stories and questions.

This year, I wanted to have a way to help people feel comfortable getting involved in the conversation and have other ways to prompt thoughts in the background, plus to lure in passers-by who may glance at the table and get interested. I decided to write out some prompts for the table, which I've recreated below, along with some other questions that I've thought about a bit more since. If you're running a similar event at your conference then please do feel free to take inspiration... or get in touch if you'd like someone to help faciliate the discussion ☺️
