I&#8217;ve been working from home a lot recently, and the primary reason (outside of my extreme train grumpiness) is that since the start of the year I&#8217;ve been trying to coordinate being here so that I can bring home some kittens. The hope is that by being here daily I can settle them in, and attempt to stop them from causing absolute carnage amongst the assortment of brightly coloured, kitten mouth-sized toys that adorn the shelves and surfaces throughout my house. As much as I&#8217;m sure an x-ray of a cat with Lego in its stomach would inevitably get some retweets, it&#8217;s something I want to avoid if at all possible!

Although slightly later than we&#8217;d originally hoped, and after the very sad death of little Garrus who we were originally going to be bringing home, I now share my house, sofa, and keyboard with the exceedingly cute Selina and Kasumi. They&#8217;re 12.5 weeks old, and are totally nuts for cooked chicken.

Despite getting a message today complaining that I haven&#8217;t been spamming my social media channels with nearly enough kitten content, I don&#8217;t want to become _that_ person more than I already am. What with my existing food-based instagram habit I&#8217;m now double the huge cliche I already was before. However, as previously mentioned, I&#8217;m big on documenting my life and will no doubt be taking a ridiculous amount of photos of them as they grow up. I&#8217;m going to try to preserve the high cat saturation levels of the internet and do my bit by sharing, but am aiming to keep it through one primary channel (though I can&#8217;t promise that some won&#8217;t end up in other places). As such, if you need any kitten stock photos, feel free to steal from my [Cats Flickr album][1]. So far the buggers are far too fast for me unless they&#8217;re asleep, but I&#8217;m sure more action photos will inevitably come.

As for work, I&#8217;m looking forward to having the combo of sleeper (Kasumi) and antagonist (Selina) pestering me all day over the next few weeks whilst I get my next batch of work jobs out of the way. I&#8217;ll make the most of it before I inevitably head back onto the great British rail network once more.
