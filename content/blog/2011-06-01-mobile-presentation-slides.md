I&#8217;m back in the UK after what I&#8217;m enjoying calling a mini European tour, and I&#8217;d like to say a big thank you to everyone that came to see me speak about mobile development in Paris and Brussels this week.

As a first time speaker this was definitely somewhat in at the deep end, but I really hope that everyone felt that the sessions were interesting and came away having learnt something. I&#8217;ve had some good feedback so far, so I&#8217;m hoping that I didn&#8217;t do too terribly! I had great fun doing both sessions, and I&#8217;d love to do more presenting in the future.

The Adobe User Groups do a fantastic job of creating a community, and obviously keeping attendees informed about a variety of topics, so I would urge you all to attend a local session if at all possible. Or perhaps submit a topic to speak about &#8211; it&#8217;s not as scary as you might imagine! Thanks to Aurélien, Cyril and Steven for having me, to Claude for being a great chaperone, and to everyone involved for making the whole process so painless.

My slides are posted below &#8211; thanks go to <a href="http://goocreative.co.uk/" target="_blank">Ben Debnam</a> for the sequence of graphics to go with the statistics &#8211; as a techie pictures of cats and devices I can manage, but Ben made my slides look a bit more like I know what I&#8217;m doing!

If anyone has any questions please feel free to get in touch, either via email (sally dot jenkinson at gmail dot com) or catch me on twitter (<a href="http://twitter.com/sjenkinson" target="_blank">sjenkinson</a>).
