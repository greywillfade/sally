I&#8217;m incredibly pleased that something I wrote has been chosen to be featured on <a title="The Pastry Box Project" href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/" target="_blank">The Pastry Box Project</a> as today&#8217;s post. When I heard that the site was being opened up to general submissions, I came home, sat on the sofa, and promptly emptied my head of some thoughts that had been swimming around inside it for a few days. As with all good musings it had started out as a pub chat, this one occurring with a friend during an incredibly bland England match, and I had originally intended to capture the sentiment in a blog post at some point. The Pastry Box however seemed like an opportunity too good to miss, and thankfully Alex and Katy seemed to like it too. I always have the perception that it&#8217;s not really the done thing to show public excitement about this kind of thing (at least amongst us Brits) and you&#8217;re probably meant to stay all aloof and professional, but sod it &#8211; I have always really enjoyed reading the posts on the site and to be a part of it is genuinely pretty exciting for me. Thanks Pastry Box folks!

Have a read of <a title="The Pastry Box" href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sally-jenkinson/2013-september-25/" target="_blank">my thoughts</a>, which are on challenging yourself to step outside of your comfort zone and to deliberately take difficult options, and then read back through the stream if you&#8217;re not familiar with the site as there&#8217;s some great stuff on there.

If you&#8217;d like to get involved too, do it! You can find more information about how to send in your thoughts on the <a title="The Pastry Box Project submissions" href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/submissions/" target="_blank">Submissions page</a>.
