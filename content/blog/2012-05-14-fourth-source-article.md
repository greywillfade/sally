Seeing as it&#8217;s been officially released into the wild now, I&#8217;m pleased to say that I&#8217;ve written an article for <a href="http://www.fourthsource.com/" target="_blank">Fourth Source</a>, an independent online digital media marketing publication. The article is &#8220;<a href="http://www.fourthsource.com/mobile/developing-an-effective-mobile-strategy-8463" target="_blank">Developing an effective mobile strategy</a>&#8220;.

Working with clients to identify the options available to them, and discussing why certain approaches may be more feasible than others should be an important part of all new projects. I&#8217;m lucky enough to work with a great Strategy team who keep me on my toes, and I look forward to being challenged by new developments in the future.

I&#8217;m looking to do more writing on industry topics, so if you&#8217;d like to discuss requirements for upcoming articles please [get in touch][1].
