Regular readers (hi Mum), may notice that things are looking a bit different around here. After a long, drawn out process, I have finally put up the latest incarnation of my site.

Those of you visiting on a mobile or tablet device will likely notice the most difference, as I&#8217;ve gone responsive. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design" target="_blank">Responsive design</a> is something that I really believe in, and it was important to me to start making some changes to reflect that.

There are still a few bugs to iron out, a few changes to make, and things I want to tidy up, but I wanted to get the site out there and make changes as I go along. If you notice anything and want to send me a useful error report please [get in touch][1].

I started redesigning the site midway through 2011, which, for me, is the most difficult part. I&#8217;m not a designer by nature, but learning and challenging myself to work at something is one of the reasons that I started a personal site in the first place. As such I went through a few iterations in Photoshop and eventually got to the stage where I started building and prototyping in the browser. After the basic structure was done I didn&#8217;t feel the colour scheme was what I was after, and I therefore needed to change a lot of the core CSS. I&#8217;d been looking into Less and Sass for a while but had never implemented CSS pre-processing into a proper individual project, and this seemed like as good a time as any considering the changes I&#8217;d be making anyway. I also amended my basic prototype to be responsive, however at the time I set my breakpoints to start from the full site downwards, which is something that I&#8217;ll be looking to amend. I re-wrote a lot of my content, including removing some elements that I&#8217;d originally planned to include as I realised I was including things for the sake of technology rather than on the basis of importance. An example was some content I was struggling with images for, which I wanted to put in a carousel that responded to touch gestures. I realised that my struggle to match meaningful images was tied to the fact that the information wasn&#8217;t actually important, and wasn&#8217;t conveying anything extra. Once everything had been stripped right back it felt a lot more effective. The final site was built using HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, ColdFusion 9, Sass, Photoshop and Git.
