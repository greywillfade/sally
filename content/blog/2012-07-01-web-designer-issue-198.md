Nestled deep within the latest issue of Web Designer Magazine (issue 198) I&#8217;m very pleased to say that I&#8217;m included as an expert comment within <a href="http://www.mattgifford.co.uk/" target="_blank">Matt Gifford&#8217;s</a> great Customise and Personalise Google Maps article.

Like many, I&#8217;m a sucker for a good API so it was a pleasure to be asked to lend my views and a tiny version of my face to the article. As usual I&#8217;m always on the lookout for more writing opportunities, so if you&#8217;d like to discuss anything please [get in touch][1].
