So here we are &#8211; 2011, and starting it with no resolutions as such, but instead a list of things that I think would be good for me, or that I&#8217;d like to try. One such thing is starting a proper blog&#8230; and sticking to it!

Firstly, on a serious note, the whole blogging thing is actually something I&#8217;ve had to put a lot of thought into in terms of balancing my voice as an individual against that of my employer. It&#8217;s obviously a fine line to tread &#8211; I have a full time job and am proud to be a representative of my company, but at the same time I really want to stress that the views in this blog may not necessarily be shared by my employer. I&#8217;m aiming for this to be a personal site, but am aware that my personal tech interests will inevitably cross over into the realms that my day job covers. Where possibly I&#8217;ll be keeping the distinction very clear.

Right, with that out of the way, I want to touch on the sort of things I&#8217;ll be covering. My professional background and a lot of my interests are heavily web/tech-related, so that&#8217;s the kind of realm we&#8217;re looking at. I&#8217;ll hopefully be putting up topics of interest to the developer community, which may cover reviews of books, information from events and conferences, and I&#8217;ll be sharing the source code from any useful developments I get around to outside of work.

One of the other things that falls under &#8216;things that I think would be good for me&#8217; is that I&#8217;m contemplating re-enrolling with the Open University in 2011, not to take any development-led courses, but to grow other complementary skills. Whether or not I&#8217;m able to spare the time for study is dependent on a few key things out of my control, but if it happens I&#8217;ll definitely be updating about what I&#8217;ve learnt and how it might help others.

So on that note, thanks for reading, and here&#8217;s to a great 2011 for everyone!
