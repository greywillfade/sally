It was announced last week that the UK government will be replacing the current Information and Communications Technology curriculum with that of a Computer Science focused course.

In a move that has been strongly welcomed by the development community, it will mean a dramatic about turn from this time last year when the government were then<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8272080/National-curriculum-review-compulsory-subjects-could-be-axed.html" target="_blank">considering making ICT a non-compulsory part of the curriculum</a>.

As someone who studied ICT throughout my school life, taking qualifications at GCSE level (age 14-16), then IT at AS and A-Level (age 16-18) I think that this is a great move. The current system revolves heavily around theory rather than practice, and is often criticised for the extent that the Microsoft Office suite is taught, with a key observation being that it seems to teach students how to be end-users rather than creators. In a world that revolves so heavily around digital, this is a real shame on several levels.
