I&#8217;m very proud to be able to say that I have been accepted as an Adobe Community Professional for 2011. It&#8217;s a big honour to be included into the ranks alongside people that I respect an incredible amount, so I&#8217;d like to say a massive thank you to Adobe, and to the individual that recommended me for inclusion in the first place.

This year there are only 234 ACPs worldwide, with an additional 87 ACCs. The full list can be seen here:Â <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-professionals-2011.html" target="blank">http://blogs.adobe.com/community/2011/01/adobe-community-professionals-2011.html</a>. Big congratulations to all of my fellow ACPs and ACCs.

2011 has already been a big year of change for me, and we&#8217;re only a month in! I&#8217;m looking to be a lot more active in the community, and as mentioned previously that&#8217;s one of the reasons for this blog. Here&#8217;s hoping that this is just the start of many more exciting community adventures for the rest of the year.
