I’m really pleased that a video of my talk from LWC 2013 is now available online. Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/lalamaguire" target="_blank">Angie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/cwaring" target="_blank">Chris</a>, and the folks at Mint Digital for the effort involved in making this happen.

(Video originally available here from here <a href="http://vimeo.com/82001994" target="_blank">http://vimeo.com/82001994</a> where you can download and share and stuff)

The slides aren’t in shot, so if you’d like to follow along <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ladieswhocode/mini-hacks-big-difference-29250792" target="_blank">they’re here</a>, and my <a href="http://recordssoundthesame.com/blog/2013/10/27/mini-hacks-big-difference-lwc-2013/" target="_blank">write up of the day is here</a>.

I’ve had one talk recorded fully before, but only as audio over slides, so this is very new for me. It’s quite bizarre watching yourself on stage in a way, as you can relive the experience from a totally different perspective. It&#8217;s definitely going to help me learn for the future though, as awkward as it is to watch yourself!

LWC was a great day, and I know that Mint are currently on the lookout for speakers for <a href="http://devslovebacon.com/" target="_blank">Devs Love Bacon</a> 2014, so if you’re thinking about speaking I&#8217;d definitely recommend that you get in touch with them.
