Having got a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">Raspberry Pi</a> for Christmas, up until today it had been sat in its original bag when it wasn&#8217;t being used. As such I decided to follow in the tradition of DIY cases and make an initial temporary case for the Pi out of Lego to give it a proper home and to hopefully reduce the likelihood of me mishandling it/getting tea on it/breaking it.

Using the remains of a 1999 <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/7151_Sith_Infiltrator" target="_blank">Sith Infiltrator</a>, and what could only have been a <a href="http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/4892_Prehistoric_Power" target="_blank">Creator Prehistoric Power</a> set along with other bricks in my spares box, I was able to come up with the above.

The case is somewhat scrappy due to being made with whatever was available, and will be upgraded at some point, potentially to a [Pibow][1] as they look pretty smart. In a happy coincidence the colours of my Lego case do however match the branding of this site to an extent, so I&#8217;ll claim that was the intention all along.

Batman and a padlock icon brick were added to provide additional security to the case.
